he transacted public business with distaste, and hastened from it to the solitude which was at once his bane and relief .
who loved him, as he did her; notwithstanding that disappointment quelled her passion, and ambition held strong combat with his .
the excitement which had hitherto sustained me was lost; as a building, whose props are loosened, and whose foundations rock, totters and falls, so when enthusiasm and hope deserted me, did my strength fail .
every thought that was devoted to it was an extreme anguish, and every word that i spoke in allusion to it caused my lips to quiver, and my heart to palpitate .
i hardly know whether i shall have the power to detail it; yet the tale which i have recorded would be incomplete without this final and wonderful catastrophe .
my life was spent among tangible realities, hers was a dream .
two o 'clock struck, after which none were admitted; those who had been disappointed went sullenly or sorrowfully away, while i entered the audience chamber .
he loved me with a guilty passion, and stung by remorse and despair he killed himself .
   ''you may easily believe, '' said he,  ''how great was the difficulty to persuade my father that all necessary knowledge was not comprised in the noble art of book keeping; and, indeed, i believe i left him incredulous to the last, for his constant answer to my unwearied entreaties was the same as that of the dutch schoolmaster in the vicar of wakefield: 'i have ten thousand florins a year without greek, i eat heartily without greek .'
could any thing but unmixed joy flow from such a union?
i am not like one of these; they influenced millions: but if i can influence but a hundred, but ten, but one solitary individual, so as in any way to lead him from ill to good, that will be a joy to repay me for all my sufferings, though they were a million times multiplied; and that hope will support me to bear them .
alexander was a king; solomon, the wisest of men, was a king; napoleon was a king; caesar died in his attempt to become one, and cromwell, the puritan and king killer, aspired to regality .
i could offer no explanation of them, but their truth in part relieved the burden of my mysterious woe .
what wonder then, in time of siege, want, extreme heat, and drought, that it should make unaccustomed ravages?
a frightful selfishness hurried me on, while my heart was poisoned with remorse .
with faltering accents clara promised, while she still clung to her father in a transport of sorrow .
but, come, this splenetic fit is already passed; resume your functions; your partizans will hail you; your enemies be silenced; our love, honour, and duty will again be manifested towards you .
i could never, while with him, think of his bounty as a remedy to my poverty; and i even put aside hastily his offers of supplies, assuring him of a falsehood, that i needed them not .
felix was too delicate to accept this offer, yet he looked forward to the probability of the event as to the consummation of his happiness .
when i was about five years old, while making an excursion beyond the frontiers of italy, they passed a week on the shores of the lake of como .
he pointed out to me the shifting colours of the landscape and the appearances of the sky .
and thus it was that although the spirit of friendship soothed me for a while it could not restore me .
i had not despaired, nor had i yet conceived the idea of returning if set free .
i wish to prepare you for the woeful news, but i know it is impossible; even now your eye skims over the page to seek the words which are to convey to you the horrible tidings .
this hour, melancholy yet sweet, has always seemed to me the time when we are most naturally led to commune with higher powers; our mortal sternness departs, and gentle complacency invests the soul .
my courage and perseverance were invigorated by these scoffing words; i resolved not to fail in my purpose, and calling on heaven to support me, i continued with unabated fervour to traverse immense deserts, until the ocean appeared at a distance and formed the utmost boundary of the horizon .
this expedition has been the favourite dream of my early years .
well, this could not last .
she had to do this, while in deep woe she sighed for loneliness, and would gladly have exchanged her crowded rooms for dark forest depths, or a drear, night enshadowed heath .
 ''felix trembled violently as he said this .
i remembered that idris had been kept in ignorance of my proceedings .
yet we were not all to die .
the vast cities of america, the fertile plains of hindostan, the crowded abodes of the chinese, are menaced with utter ruin .
but clara was jealous of their services; she would be sole handmaid of idris, sole minister to the wants of her little cousins; nothing gave her so much pleasure as our employing her in this way; she went beyond our desires, earnest, diligent, and unwearied, abra was ready ere we called her name, and though we called another, abra came .
he had begun his speech with vehemence; he ended with unassuming gentleness, making his appeal with the same humility, as if he had asked to be the first in wealth, honour, and power among englishmen, and not, as was the truth, to be the foremost in the ranks of loathsome toils and inevitable death .
he declared, notwithstanding her harshness, he even called it coldness, that he loved her .
remember the friends around you, who centre all their hopes in you .
i darted towards the spot from which the sound proceeded, but the devil eluded my grasp .
several hours passed, and i remained near my window gazing on the sea; it was almost motionless, for the winds were hushed, and all nature reposed under the eye of the quiet moon .
some were destroyed; the major part escaped by quick and well ordered movements; and danger made them careful .
the passionate and almost reverential attachment with which all regarded her became, while i shared it, my pride and my delight .
he loved enterprise, hardship, and even danger for its own sake .
anguish and despair had penetrated into the core of my heart; i bore a hell within me which nothing could extinguish .
he began at last to shew signs of angry impatience, and perdita became aware that the system she had adopted could not continue; she must explain herself to him; she could not summon courage to speak she wrote thus:  ''read this letter with patience, i entreat you .
death is the goal that i would attain, but, alas i do not even see the end of the course .
the inhabitants of berkshire and bucks had been long aware that the plague was in london, in liverpool, bristol, manchester, york, in short, in all the more populous towns of england .
do not for ever look sorrow and never speak it; utter one word of bitter complaint and i will reprove it with gentle exhortation and pour on you the balm of compassion .
if she had been nurtured by those who had regarded her with affection, she might have been different; but unloved and neglected, she repaid want of kindness with distrust and silence .
in person, he hardly appeared of this world; his slight frame was overinformed by the soul that dwelt within; he was all mind;  ''man but a rush against '' his breast, and it would have conquered his strength; but the might of his smile would have tamed an hungry lion, or caused a legion of armed men to lay their weapons at his feet .
this was the key of my design .
has she not bestowed on him every gift in prodigality?
i am a part of this scene; each and all its properties are a part of me .
the report of the pistol brought a crowd into the room .
our empty habitations remained, but the dwellers were gathered to the shades of the tomb .
but other ingredients mingled with these, and prevented him from becoming the calculating, determined character, which alone forms a successful hero .
they looked at one another and were unable to reply .
there was a simple, natural earnestness about her that interested me in her fate, especially when she assured me that her husband was the best of men, had been so, till want of business during these unhappy times had thrown him into bad company .
it was small relief to him that our discipline should gain us success in such a conflict; while plague still hovered to equalize the conqueror and the conquered, it was not victory that he desired, but bloodless peace .
ever since the fatal night, the end of my labours, and the beginning of my misfortunes, i had conceived a violent antipathy even to the name of natural philosophy .
perdita shook her head;  ''if it could be so, '' she replied,  ''i were much in the wrong to disdain your offers .
it is our distance from them and our imperfect means of communication that makes them appear to move; in truth they always remain stationary, a glorious centre, giving us a fine lesson of modesty if we would thus receive it . ''
as yet the mind alone had suffered could i for ever put off the time, when the delicate frame and shrinking nerves of my child of prosperity, the nursling of rank and wealth, who was my companion, should be invaded by famine, hardship, and disease?
my father felt that his fall was near; but so far from profiting by this last calm before the storm to save himself, he sought to forget anticipated evil by making still greater sacrifices to the deity of pleasure, deceitful and cruel arbiter of his destiny .
one part was open, and by that i had crept in; but now i covered every crevice by which i might be perceived with stones and wood, yet in such a manner that i might move them on occasion to pass out; all the light i enjoyed came through the sty, and that was sufficient for me .
how often have i wept over that letter which untill i was sixteen was the only relick i had to remind me of my parents .
when others were there he often spoke to me and his eyes perpetually followed my slightest motion .
at last the crisis came: the night when parliament, which had so long delayed its choice, must decide: as the hour of twelve passed, and the new day began, it was by virtue of the constitution dissolved, its power extinct .
my father wished her not to go but said that he left it to her own judgment and feelings to decide .
 ''he is dead '' said adrian, as the corpse fell from his arms on the ground, and he bowed his head in sorrow and awe .
with all the energy of desperate grief i told him how i had fallen at once from bliss to misery; how that for me there was no joy, no hope; that death however bitter would be the welcome seal to all my pangs; death the skeleton was to be beautiful as love .
the physician came and prescribed medicines, and the old woman prepared them for me; but utter carelessness was visible in the first, and the expression of brutality was strongly marked in the visage of the second .
i shall not be suspected of being averse to the greek cause; i know and feel its necessity; it is beyond every other a good cause .
increase of knowledge only discovered to me more clearly what a wretched outcast i was .
for a moment only did i lose recollection; i fell senseless on the ground .
i looked on these; i turned my gaze to my own mean dress .
nor did her angry dislike prevent adrian from imaging my father, as he had said, the type of all that was gallant, amiable, and fascinating in man .
he had abandoned me, and in the bitterness of my heart i cursed him .
you, my creator, abhor me; what hope can i gather from your fellow creatures, who owe me nothing?
under the idea of initiating me in the scene of english politics and society, of which i was soon to become a part, he narrated a number of anecdotes, and sketched many characters; his discourse, rich and varied, flowed on, pervading all my senses with pleasure .
he talked of geneva, which i should soon visit, of elizabeth and ernest; but these words only drew deep groans from me .
we are born; we choose neither our parents, nor our station; we are educated by others, or by the world 's circumstance, and this cultivation, mingling with our innate disposition, is the soil in which our desires, passions, and motives grow . ''
i hailed the darkness that shut ireland from my sight, and my pulse beat with a feverish joy when i reflected that i should soon see geneva .
but a home of love awaits you in your native england .
i am glad that i have seen the changes of his day; to behold the sun, fountain of light, and the gentle pilgrim moon; to have seen the fire bearing flowers of the sky, and the flowery stars of earth; to have witnessed the sowing and the harvest .
so saying, he stepped aside and wrote down a list of several books treating of natural philosophy which he desired me to procure, and dismissed me after mentioning that in the beginning of the following week he intended to commence a course of lectures upon natural philosophy in its general relations, and that m  . waldman, a fellow professor, would lecture upon chemistry the alternate days that he omitted.
raymond, being somewhat recovered, prepared to re assume his command in the army .
the labour of winding among the little paths of the mountain and fixing my feet firmly as i advanced perplexed me, occupied as i was by the emotions which the occurrences of the day had produced .
he at last fell down in convulsions .
sleep fled from my eyes; i wandered like an evil spirit, for i had committed deeds of mischief beyond description horrible, and more, much more i persuaded myself was yet behind .
your affectionate brother, robert walton letter july th, to mrs  . saville, england my dear sister, i write a few lines in haste to say that i am safe and well advanced on my voyage.
then we shall find elinor and what i have lost .
his information was at first received with silence; a confused murmur succeeded; and, when the chairman declared lord raymond duly chosen, it amounted to a shout of applause and victory .
my abhorrence of this fiend cannot be conceived .
bankers, merchants, and manufacturers, whose trade depended on exports and interchange of wealth, became bankrupt .
my mother, pennyless and burthened with two children, waited week after week, and month after month, in sickening expectation of a reply, which never came .
we sunk into silence: a silence that drank in the doleful accounts and prognostications of our guest .
the least illness caused throes of terror; she was miserable if she were at all absent from them; her treasure of happiness she had garnered in their fragile being, and kept forever on the watch, lest the insidious thief should as before steal these valued gems .
i awoke half stupefied; i felt a heavy oppression on me, but knew not wherefore; i entered, as it were, the council chamber of my brain, and questioned the various ministers of thought therein assembled; too soon i remembered all; too soon my limbs quivered beneath the tormenting power; soon, too soon, i knew myself a slave suddenly, unannounced, lord raymond entered my apartment .
her father grew worse; her time was more entirely occupied in attending him; her means of subsistence decreased; and in the tenth month her father died in her arms, leaving her an orphan and a beggar .
shall i not then hate them who abhor me?
you seek for knowledge and wisdom, as i once did; and i ardently hope that the gratification of your wishes may not be a serpent to sting you, as mine has been .
there were still a few hackney coaches accustomed to stand about the streets, more truly from habit than for use .
felix visited the grate at night and made known to the prisoner his intentions in his favour .
you have given me new wants and now your trifle with me as if my heart were as whole as yours, as if i were not in truth a shorn lamb thrust out on the bleak hill side, tortured by every blast .
he perceived the cloud gathering, and tried to dissipate it; but the strength of my feelings would not permit me to pass thus lightly over this sacred subject; so i said emphatically,  ''permit me to remark, that i am devotedly attached to the earl of windsor; he is my best friend and benefactor .
wordsworth has compared a beloved female to two fair objects in nature; but his lines always appeared to me rather a contrast than a similitude: a violet by a mossy stone half hidden from the eye, fair as a star when only one is shining in the sky .
raymond gave her his ring to ensure the respect of the menials .
he drew a glowing picture of its present situation .
i stood ready to receive and reply to his reproaches .
we were all equal now; but near at hand was an equality still more levelling, a state where beauty and strength, and wisdom, would be as vain as riches and birth .
the death of william, the execution of justine, the murder of clerval, and lastly of my wife; even at that moment i knew not that my only remaining friends were safe from the malignity of the fiend; my father even now might be writhing under his grasp, and ernest might be dead at his feet .
the night mare became torture; with a strong effort i threw off sleep, and recalled reason to her wonted functions .
chapter vi my chamber was in a retired part of the house, and looked upon the garden so that no sound of the other inhabitants could reach it; and here in perfect solitude i wept for several hours .
the starry sky, the sea, and every sight afforded by these wonderful regions seem still to have the power of elevating his soul from earth .
she hardly looked up  ''you can do me no good, '' she replied;  ''i must go to the hospital; if i do not die before i get there . ''
i did not desire sympathy and aid in ambition or wisdom, but sweet and mutual affection; smiles to cheer me and gentle words of comfort .
as windsor lay, to a great degree, in the line of march from the west, i removed my family to london, assigning the tower for their sojourn, and joining adrian, acted as his lieutenant in the coming struggle .
ryland groaned; cold drops stood on his brow .
i must be more brief for night draws on apace and all my hours in this house are counted .
for this was it a glorious, for this was it an honourable undertaking .
the tenor of my actions will prove that i had rather die, than be a mark for scorn behold the proud evadne in her tatters look on the beggar princess there is aspic venom in the thought promise me that my secret shall not be violated by you . ''
after the revolution of ages birnam hill was again covered with a young forest, while more aged pines, planted at the very commencement of the nineteenth century by the then duke of athol, gave solemnity and beauty to the scene .
but let me, it is my last entreaty, let me in the praises of his countrymen and the prosperity of england, find the choice of my youth justified . ''
shall man be the enemy of man, while plague, the foe to all, even now is above us, triumphing in our butchery, more cruel than her own? ''
i paused some time to reflect on all he had related and the various arguments which he had employed .
i was now conscious of a change .
i threw myself into the carriage that was to convey me away, hardly knowing whither i was going, and careless of what was passing around .
to change the scene for her, and even for ourselves, all unhinged by the cloud that had come over us, i persuaded my two remaining companions that it were better that we should absent ourselves for a time from windsor .
but in the city things wore a different face .
i had determined, if you were going southwards, still to trust myself to the mercy of the seas rather than abandon my purpose .
his serious mien recalled, by some association, the half forgotten evadne to my mind, and i seized this opportunity to make enquiries from him concerning her strange lot .
i ran on at my utmost speed until i found myself i knew not how, close to westminster abbey, and was attracted by the deep and swelling tone of the organ .
do you think nature composed his surpassing machine for no purpose?
but these cares of clerval were made of no avail when i visited the professors .
but woodville 's words had magic in them, when beginning with the sweetest pity, he would raise me by degrees out of myself and my sorrows until i wondered at my own selfishness: but he left me and despair returned; the work of consolation was ever to begin anew .
but i forget myself, my tale is yet untold .
oh what a night it was and i passed on with quick steps among the high, dank grass amid the rain and tempest .
no father had watched my infant days, no mother had blessed me with smiles and caresses; or if they had, all my past life was now a blot, a blind vacancy in which i distinguished nothing .
but life was yet strong within me; i recovered: nor did it a little aid my returning health that my recollections were at first vague, and that i was too weak to feel any violent emotion .
she knew that raymond had conversed with her; had he instigated this request?
come, i see that you are already persuaded, and will second me when i propose him to night in parliament . ''
she listened eagerly to him, yet tantalized herself by giving to his words a meaning foreign to their true interpretation, and adverse to her hopes .
it was a life of toil; for rain and cold were more frequent than sunshine; but it was my pride to contemn the elements .
she was there, lifeless and inanimate, thrown across the bed, her head hanging down and her pale and distorted features half covered by her hair .
but although st  . stephen 's did not echo with the voice which filled each heart, the newspapers teemed with nothing else; and in private companies the conversation however remotely begun, soon verged towards this central point, while voices were lowered and chairs drawn closer.
i go; but remember, i shall be with you on your wedding night . ''
he demanded the place of deputy as his right .
such would be my liberty except that in my elizabeth i possessed a treasure, alas, balanced by those horrors of remorse and guilt which would pursue me until death .
i could not do otherwise, even if i had wished; for if we are said to have two souls, he was my better soul, to which the other was a perpetual slave .
but her rights with regard to him, and her cherished independence, should not be injured by the idea of interest, or the intervention of the complicated feelings attendant on pecuniary obligation, and the relative situations of the benefactor, and benefited .
we entered london in the evening, and went to our several abodes near hyde park .
the care of me while a baby, and afterwards untill i had reached my eighth year devolved on a servant of my mother 's, who had accompanied us in our retirement for that purpose .
 ''but do not you see, lionel, the drift of our noble friend; a drift, perhaps, unknown to himself, but apparent to me .
 ''it is a strange link in my fate that without having seen you i should passionately love you .
i returned to windsor by the long walk, and passing through the town towards the castle, i found it in a state of agitation and disturbance .
we went together to the house in the evening .
my country, my beloved country who but a native can tell the delight i took in again beholding thy streams, thy mountains, and, more than all, thy lovely lake yet, as i drew nearer home, grief and fear again overcame me .
her countenance was all expression; her eyes were not dark, but impenetrably deep; you seemed to discover space after space in their intellectual glance, and to feel that the soul which was their soul, comprehended an universe of thought in its ken .
thus far i have gone, tracing a secure way over the pathless seas, the very stars themselves being witnesses and testimonies of my triumph .
i had now neglected my promise for some time, and i feared the effects of the daemon 's disappointment .
evadne 's feminine prudence perceived how useless any assertion of his resolves would be, till added years gave weight to his power .
he is a soldier, a general .
she tried to rouse herself, but her eyes every now and then filled with tears, and she looked wistfully on raymond and her girl, as if fearful that some evil would betide them .
but such miseries could never intrude upon the domestic circle left to me, while, secluded in our beloved forest, we passed our lives in tranquillity .
do you also join with my enemies to crush me, to condemn me as a murderer? ''
walking, riding, the common occupations of life, overcame him: he felt no pain, but seemed to tremble for ever on the verge of annihilation .
she spoke quickly, as if to convince herself; she turned her eyes from the trees and forest paths she loved; she hid her face in my bosom, and we yes, my masculine firmness dissolved we wept together consolatory tears, and then calm nay, almost cheerful, we returned to the castle .
seven years ago, in her youthful prime, she had become attached to him; he had served her country against the turks; he had in her own land acquired that military glory peculiarly dear to the greeks, since they were still obliged inch by inch to fight for their security .
there was evidently something behind all this; yet, when he appeared about to speak of that which was nearest his heart, he would abruptly turn away, and with a sigh endeavour to deliver the painful idea to the winds .
i appear to have strength, power, victory; standing as a dome supporting column stands; and i am a reed i have ambition, and that attains its aim; my nightly dreams are realized, my waking hopes fulfilled; a kingdom awaits my acceptance, my enemies are overthrown .
i heard of the difference of sexes, and the birth and growth of children, how the father doted on the smiles of the infant, and the lively sallies of the older child, how all the life and cares of the mother were wrapped up in the precious charge, how the mind of youth expanded and gained knowledge, of brother, sister, and all the various relationships which bind one human being to another in mutual bonds .
perdita reproached us bitterly .
do not endeavour to deprive me of my companion, the out cast 's friend .
at about midnight raymond and i took leave of my sister, to return to town .
great pains had been taken in the scenery to give the semblance of reality to the impossible .
as he spoke, i felt subject to him; and all my boasted pride and strength were subdued by the honeyed accents of this blue eyed boy .
 ''next summer, '' said adrian as we parted on our return to windsor,  ''will decide the fate of the human race .
and yet you are still unhappy and still avoid our society .
such was the maniac language of her enthusiasm .
i have said, that the defects of her character awoke and acquired vigour from her unnatural position .
perdita was sensible of the failing of the tide that fed her life .
everything was made to yield to her wishes and her convenience .
joy and exultation, were mine, to possess, and to save her .
i can do this i can marry idris . ''
we asked: can we enter here?
on every point of general literature he displays unbounded knowledge and a quick and piercing apprehension .
 ''we know not what all this wide world means; its strange mixture of good and evil .
and then of what use would be pursuit?
raymond was inspirited by the intense sensations of recovered health; he felt that in being general of the athenians, he filled a post worthy of his ambition; and, in his hope of the conquest of constantinople, he counted on an event which would be as a landmark in the waste of ages, an exploit unequalled in the annals of man; when a city of grand historic association, the beauty of whose site was the wonder of the world, which for many hundred years had been the strong hold of the moslems, should be rescued from slavery and barbarism, and restored to a people illustrious for genius, civilization, and a spirit of liberty .
we lengthened our tour into scotland, that we might see loch katrine and loch lomond; thence we crossed to ireland, and passed several weeks in the neighbourhood of killarney .
in a fit of enthusiastic madness i created a rational creature and was bound towards him to assure, as far as was in my power, his happiness and well being .
one of his servants, while waiting on him, had suddenly fallen down dead .
then, agitated as she had been by her mother 's violence, and now by unaccustomed fears, she lay unable to sleep, starting at every sound .
the green woods waved their boughs majestically, while the dying were spread beneath their shade, answering the solemn melody with inharmonious cries .
she shed indeed many tears; her head sunk unconsciously on the shoulder of raymond; he held her hand: he kissed her sunken tear stained cheek .
yet how was i to do this?
on landing at athens we found difficulties encrease upon us: nor could the storied earth or balmy atmosphere inspire us with enthusiasm or pleasure, while the fate of raymond was in jeopardy .
he had sought this office with eagerness, under the idea of turning his whole forces to the suppression of the privileged orders of our community .
in m  . waldman i found a true friend.
she told me, that she had kept up her strength and courage till her arrival at my cottage, and then both failed .
we felt extreme delight at our escape from political turmoil, and sought our solitude with redoubled zest .
but he has already recovered his spirits, and is reported to be on the point of marrying a lively pretty frenchwoman, madame tavernier .
he shewed how england had become powerful, and its inhabitants valiant and wise, by means of the freedom they enjoyed .
she endeavoured to bring him up in a sense of resentment towards, and a desire to revenge himself upon, those who had been instrumental in bringing about his father 's abdication .
he would come triumphantly to the district to which my parent had fled broken hearted; he would find the ill fated offspring, bequeathed with such vain confidence to his royal father, miserable paupers .
as my sickness quitted me, i was absorbed by a gloomy and black melancholy that nothing could dissipate .
for awhile my labours were not solitary; but that time is gone; and, with the selected and matchless companion of my toils, their dearest reward is also lost to me di mie tenere frondi altro lavoro credea mostrarte; e qual fero pianeta ne ' nvidio insieme, o mio nobil tesoro?
his soul was sympathy, and dedicated to the worship of beauty and excellence .
i owe this to greece, to you, to my surviving perdita, and to myself, the victim of ambition . ''
i took it up and placed it in my breast .
there is an expression of despair, and sometimes of revenge, in your countenance that makes me tremble .
there was a show of gratitude and worship in his attachment to my mother, differing wholly from the doting fondness of age, for it was inspired by reverence for her virtues and a desire to be the means of, in some degree, recompensing her for the sorrows she had endured, but which gave inexpressible grace to his behaviour to her .
it came as some gentle visitation; it went and i hardly felt the loss .
you minutely described in these papers every step you took in the progress of your work; this history was mingled with accounts of domestic occurrences .
why do you bring me out, and torture me, and tempt me, and kill me much happier would it be for you and for me if in your frantic curiosity you tore my heart from my breast and tried to read its secrets in it as its life 's blood was dropping from it .
 ''i thank you, but all that you mention is nothing to me; on the whole earth there is no comfort which i am capable of receiving . ''
 ''now, dear victor, i dare say you wish to be indulged in a little gossip concerning the good people of geneva .
a few incidents now and then directed me, and i possessed a map of the country; but i often wandered wide from my path .
the females received them on their return with the simple and affectionate welcome known before only to the lowly cottage a clean hearth and bright fire; the supper ready cooked by beloved hands; gratitude for the provision for to morrow 's meal: strange enjoyments for the high born english, yet they were now their sole, hard earned, and dearly prized luxuries .
in vain did the eye strive to find the wreck of some northern cloud in the stainless empyrean, which might bring hope of change and moisture to the oppressive and windless atmosphere .
sometimes he thought that i felt deeply the degradation of being obliged to answer a charge of murder, and he endeavoured to prove to me the futility of pride .
my death is rapidly approaching and you are not near to watch the flitting and vanishing of my spirit .
he woodville, mourned the loss of his bride: others wept the various forms of misery as they visited them: but infamy and guilt was mingled with my portion; unlawful and detestable passion had poured its poison into my ears and changed all my blood, so that it was no longer the kindly stream that supports life but a cold fountain of bitterness corrupted in its very source .
he would embark in a balloon; he would sail for a distant quarter of the world, where his name and humiliation were unknown .
by degrees his health was shaken by his misery, and then his intellect yielded to the same tyranny .
this answer startled me, but i presently recovered myself .
i found if sorrow was dead within me, so was love and desire of sympathy .
listen to me, and then reflect if you ought to win me to your project, even if with the over bearing eloquence of despair you could make black death so inviting that the fair heaven should appear darkness .
at the moment, i felt convinced that i was acting for the best, and that all i did was right and even necessary .
you doubtless recollect these papers .
some gazed on these processions with wild eagerness others fled timidly some wept aloud .
all factitious colouring disappeared death rose like night, and, protected by its murky shadows the blush of modesty, the reserve of pride, the decorum of prudery were frequently thrown aside as useless veils .
then the appearance of death was distant, although the wish was ever present to my thoughts; and i often sat for hours motionless and speechless, wishing for some mighty revolution that might bury me and my destroyer in its ruins .
while i was thus engaged, ernest entered: he had heard me arrive, and hastened to welcome me:  ''welcome, my dearest victor, '' said he  .  ''ah i wish you had come three months ago, and then you would have found us all joyous and delighted.
alfred 's serious air shewed that he still revolved the tragic story related by the italian boy .
such had been ryland 's plan, and he was discovered dead and half devoured by insects, in a house many miles from any other, with piles of food laid up in useless superfluity .
she prayed for her husband 's soul; she conjured the supreme to place on her head the crime of his self destruction she vowed to live to expiate his fault .
it must be the excess of madness that could make me imagine that i could ever be aught but one alone; struck off from humanity; bearing no affinity to man or woman; a wretch on whom nature had set her ban .
do you think that i will be questioned, and my replies disdainfully set aside? do you think that i will be suspected, perhaps watched, cross questioned, and disbelieved?
each felt, that england had never seen a protector so capable of fulfilling the arduous duties of that high office .
happy, thrice happy, were the months, and weeks, and hours of that year .
adrian suddenly vanished; and, by the time that raymond 's supporters were reduced to our intimate friends merely, returned leading idris to congratulate her friend on his success .
 ''yet how can i expect you to sympathize with me?
i heard my sister 's sobs, and thought, happy are women who can weep, and in a passionate caress disburthen the oppression of their feelings; shame and habitual restraint hold back a man .
through this crevice a small room was visible, whitewashed and clean but very bare of furniture .
i did not tell her, that to spare her the pang of parting from inanimate objects, now the only things left, i had resolved that we should none of us return to windsor .
i left a guard to protect this treasure of dust; and ordered perpetual torches to be burned around .
 ''and yet you rescued me from a strange and perilous situation; you have benevolently restored me to life . ''
to the south then, to the sun where nature is kind, where jove has showered forth the contents of amalthea 's horn, and earth is garden .
if an old roman of the period of the republic had returned to life, and talked of the impending election of some laurel crowned consul, or of the last battle with mithridates, his ideas would not have been more alien to the times, than the conversation of merrival .
he feared that the intensity of his passion might become the subject of their ridicule; and he could not bear that they should blaspheme it by considering that trivial and transitory which he felt was the life of his life .
how could i save them?
some of my comrades groaned, and my own mind began to grow watchful with anxious thoughts, when a strange sight suddenly attracted our attention and diverted our solicitude from our own situation .
the genius that enlightened her countenance, was now united to an expression of benevolence, which gave divine perfection to her beauty .
agatha fainted, and safie, unable to attend to her friend, rushed out of the cottage .
 ''it was dark when i awoke; i felt cold also, and half frightened, as it were, instinctively, finding myself so desolate .
we did not know how far he had to go, and soon separated, supposing that in a short time he would return to the palace with perdita, and that they would not be sorry to find themselves alone .
the ruins of majestic oaks which had grown, flourished, and decayed during the progress of centuries, marked where the limits of the forest once reached, while the shattered palings and neglected underwood shewed that this part was deserted for the younger plantations, which owed their birth to the beginning of the nineteenth century, and now stood in the pride of maturity .
it was, indeed, a filthy process in which i was engaged .
having cast her fate upon a die, and feeling secure of winning, she, whom i have named as bearing the stamp of queen of nations on her noble brow, now rose superior to humanity, and seemed in calm power, to arrest with her finger, the wheel of destiny .
her person was formed in the most feminine proportions; she was not tall, but her mountain life had given freedom to her motions, so that her light step scarce made her foot fall heard as she tript across the hall to meet me .
this was the only cloud in the azure of her happiness .
 ''you turn from me; yet before you deny me reflect, woodville, how sweet it were to cast off the load of tears and misery under which we now labour: and surely we shall find light after we have passed the dark valley .
he was too upright and noble to do aught that his conscience would not approve; i did not yet know of the crime there may be in involuntary feeling and therefore ascribed his tumultuous starts and gloomy looks wholly to the struggles of his mind and not any as they were partly due to the worst fiend of all remorse .
after this martha was seated more firmly than ever on the regal seat, elevated by reverence and love .
the latter method of obtaining the desired intelligence was dilatory and unsatisfactory; besides, i had an insurmountable aversion to the idea of engaging myself in my loathsome task in my father 's house while in habits of familiar intercourse with those i loved .
i fulfilled my commission; i saw karazza .
ay, ay, '' continued he, observing my face expressive of suffering,  ''m .
during my father 's life time i had always been of an affectionate and forbearing disposition, but since those days of joy alas i was much changed .
we were lifted above the alpine peaks, and from their deep and brawling ravines entered the plain of fair france, and after an airy journey of six days, we landed at dieppe, furled the feathered wings, and closed the silken globe of our little pinnace .
oh beloved one, i am borne away; i can no longer sustain myself; surely this is death that is coming .
the very spirit of the greek mythology inhabited my heart; i deified the uplands, glades, and streams, i had sight of proteus coming from the sea; and heard old triton blow his wreathed horn .
 ''as the night advanced, a fierce wind arose from the woods and quickly dispersed the clouds that had loitered in the heavens; the blast tore along like a mighty avalanche and produced a kind of insanity in my spirits that burst all bounds of reason and reflection .
genius, devotion, and courage; the adornments of his mind, and the energies of his soul, all exerted to their uttermost stretch, could not roll back one hair  's breadth the wheel of time's chariot; that which had been was written with the adamantine pen of reality, on the everlasting volume of the past; nor could agony and tears suffice to wash out one iota from the act fulfilled .
it is also a duty owed to yourself, for excessive sorrow prevents improvement or enjoyment, or even the discharge of daily usefulness, without which no man is fit for society . ''
i now sought adrian, anxious to hear the result of his discussion with ryland .
the news spread through athens, and the whole city poured out at the gate of the piraeus, down the roads, through the vineyards, the olive woods and plantations of fig trees, towards the harbour .
the blue mediterranean appeared, and by a strange chance, i saw the fiend enter by night and hide himself in a vessel bound for the black sea .
this appeared to him the primary step towards manhood, and he was proportionably pleased .
if i can save one of her mighty spirits from the deadly shaft; if i can ward disease from one of her smiling cottages, i shall not have lived in vain . ''
i watched over my hasty temper, subdued my burning impatience of character, schooled my self engrossing thoughts, educating myself to the best perfection i might attain, that the fruit of my exertions might be his happiness .
our castle became an asylum for the unhappy .
regiment after regiment advanced, their colours flying and bands playing .
soon we heard their disorderly clamour, the barbarian shouts, the untimed step of thousands coming on in disarray .
with sunken cheek and hollow eyes, pale and gaunt, how could i recognize the beloved of perdita?
i watched him, but could make but little of him .
i must do justice to my sweet sister: it was not for herself that she was thus agonized .
their pronunciation was quick, and the words they uttered, not having any apparent connection with visible objects, i was unable to discover any clue by which i could unravel the mystery of their reference .
his course was speedily decided upon .
he was incapable of meeting these evils by any comprehensive system; he had resorted to expedient after expedient, and could never be induced to put a remedy in force, till it came too late to be of use .
the sun of youth is not set for you; it will restore vigour and life to you; do not resist with obstinate grief its beneficent influence, oh, my child bless me with the hope that i have not utterly destroyed you .
idris sat at the bedside, holding evelyn 's hand; we were afraid to speak to each other; i watched the stars i hung over my child i felt his little pulse i drew near the mother again i receded .
then mighty art thou, o wind, to be throned above all other vicegerents of nature 's power; whether thou comest destroying from the east, or pregnant with elementary life from the west; thee the clouds obey; the sun is subservient to thee; the shoreless ocean is thy slave thou sweepest over the earth, and oaks, the growth of centuries, submit to thy viewless axe; the snow drift is scattered on the pinnacles of the alps, the avalanche thunders down their vallies .
but it was augmented and rendered sublime by the mighty alps, whose white and shining pyramids and domes towered above all, as belonging to another earth, the habitations of another race of beings .
i and my enemy were still struggling, when the wounded man exclaimed,  ''the earl '' i sprang out of the herculean hold of the keeper, panting from my exertions; i cast furious glances on my persecutors, and placing myself with my back to a tree, resolved to defend myself to the last .
they were in the end all sunk, and, with the exception of two or three prisoners, the crews drowned .
adrian replied,  ''whither indeed would you fly?
but i did not feel the inconvenience of the weather; my imagination was busy in scenes of evil and despair .
i often refused to accompany him, alleging another engagement, that i might remain alone .
i returned to my family estate in the autumn of the year  .
at first his mother treated his theories as the wild ravings of inexperience .
perhaps, after the labours and stupendous excitement of the past summer, the calm of winter and the almost menial toils it brought with it, were by natural re action doubly irksome .
my father observed with pain the alteration perceptible in my disposition and habits and endeavoured by arguments deduced from the feelings of his serene conscience and guiltless life to inspire me with fortitude and awaken in me the courage to dispel the dark cloud which brooded over me .
this state lasted but for an instant; the scream was repeated, and i rushed into the room .
but other generations will arise, and ever and for ever will continue, to be made happier by our present acts, to be glorified by our valour .
soon some people, deputed by the magistrates, came to remove the body; the unfortunate being saw a jailor in each he fled precipitately, while i passed onwards to the castle .
sheath your weapons; these are your brothers, commit not fratricide; soon the plague will not leave one for you to glut your revenge upon: will you be more pitiless than pestilence?
this reflection thawed my congealing blood, and again the tide of life and love flowed impetuously onward, again to ebb as my busy thoughts changed .
my companion looked eagerly from one bed to the other, till at the end of the ward she espied, on a wretched bed, a squalid, haggard creature, writhing under the torture of disease .
 ''this reading had puzzled me extremely at first, but by degrees i discovered that he uttered many of the same sounds when he read as when he talked .
i revolved again and again all that i remembered my mother to have told me of my father 's former life; i contemplated the few relics i possessed belonging to him, which spoke of greater refinement than could be found among the mountain cottages; but nothing in all this served as a guide to lead me to another and pleasanter way of life .
i little expected, in this enlightened and scientific age, to find a disciple of albertus magnus and paracelsus .
she continued her course along the precipitous sides of the river, when suddenly her foot slipped, and she fell into the rapid stream .
the perfect confidence that subsisted between perdita and him, rendered every communication common between them .
to tell all my grief i might as well attempt to count the tears that have fallen from these eyes, or every sign that has torn my heart .
does not a stream, boundless as ocean, deep as vacuum, yawn between us? '' raymond rose, his voice was broken, his features convulsed, his manner calm as the earthquake cradling atmosphere, he replied:  ''i am rejoiced that you take my decision so philosophically .
yesterday those limbs were worth an universe; they then enshrined a transcendant power, whose intents, words, and actions were worthy to be recorded in letters of gold; now the superstition of affection alone could give value to the shattered mechanism, which, incapable and clod like, no more resembled raymond, than the fallen rain is like the former mansion of cloud in which it climbed the highest skies, and gilded by the sun, attracted all eyes, and satiated the sense by its excess of beauty .
perhaps also my passion was lulled to content by the deep and exclusive affection you felt for me .
some trifling business of the house having been gone through, the leaders took their seats in the chamber; the clamour of voices continued, till ryland arose to speak, and then the slightest whispered observation was audible .
i had sufficient leisure for these and many other reflections during my journey to ingolstadt, which was long and fatiguing .
i covered it carefully with dry wood and leaves and placed wet branches upon it; and then, spreading my cloak, i lay on the ground and sank into sleep .
the selected passion of the soul of raymond was ambition .
but he found that a traveller 's life is one that includes much pain amidst its enjoyments .
the forest was dressed in green; the young calves frisked on the new sprung grass; the wind winged shadows of light clouds sped over the green cornfields; the hermit cuckoo repeated his monotonous all hail to the season; the nightingale, bird of love and minion of the evening star, filled the woods with song; while venus lingered in the warm sunset, and the young green of the trees lay in gentle relief along the clear horizon .
you must not shut me from all communion with you: do not tell me why you grieve but only say the words,  ''i am unhappy, '' and you will feel relieved as if for some time excluded from all intercourse by some magic spell you should suddenly enter again the pale of human sympathy .
my poor sister looked at the counsellor with affright .
sorrow doubles the burthen to the bent down back; plants thorns in the unyielding pillow; mingles gall with water; adds saltness to their bitter bread; cloathing them in rags, and strewing ashes on their bare heads .
my promise fulfilled, the monster would depart forever .
whence, i often asked myself, did the principle of life proceed?
i reflected on this, and by touching the various branches, i discovered the cause and busied myself in collecting a great quantity of wood, that i might dry it and have a plentiful supply of fire .
adrian leaned against the wall .
woodville for ever rose in glory; and elinor become more lovely and wise under the lessons of her accomplished lover .
i had become arrogant, peevish, and above all suspicious .
a murmur of approbation followed elizabeth 's simple and powerful appeal, but it was excited by her generous interference, and not in favour of poor justine, on whom the public indignation was turned with renewed violence, charging her with the blackest ingratitude .
 ''you will ask me, '' continued evadne,  ''what i have done since; why i have not applied for succour to the rich greeks resident here; why i have not returned to my native country?
she threw open her window, which looked on the palace garden .
sometimes she struggled with her tears, but when she was desired to plead, she collected her powers and spoke in an audible although variable voice .
i prayed them to save even from himself this scion of the noblest family in england .
when she became a widow, she turned all her thoughts to the educating her son adrian, second earl of windsor, so as to accomplish her ambitious ends; and with his mother 's milk he imbibed, and was intended to grow up in the steady purpose of re acquiring his lost crown .
this attack was directed against raymond and his machinations for the restoration of the monarchy .
chapter  ''some time elapsed before i learned the history of my friends .
i relied on your innocence, and although i was then very wretched, i was not so miserable as i am now . ''
we came at last, methought, to the brow of a huge cliff that over hung the sea which, troubled by the winds, dashed against its base at a distance .
its ponderous mass, blackened stone, and high dome, made it look, not like a temple, but a tomb .
why am i to give an account of myself?
 ''raymond has prophesied well, '' said perdita,  ''alas, that it should be so our present mode of life cannot continue long, yet i will not be the first to propose alteration .
 ''my dear girl, '' he said,  ''i have been to blame; but you must pardon me .
 ''and my brother? ''  ''is on deck, madam . ''
 ''i can offer you no consolation, my friend, '' said he;  ''your disaster is irreparable .
his praises were so many adder 's stings infixed in my vulnerable breast .
among better natures, anguish and dread, the fear of eternal separation, and the awful wonder produced by unprecedented calamity, drew closer the ties of kindred and friendship .
while the earth lasts, his actions will be recorded with praise .
but my essay towards bringing her to a saner view of her own situation, did not end here .
i thought i saw elizabeth, in the bloom of health, walking in the streets of ingolstadt .
after a short repose i prepared to leave her, that i might endeavour to accomplish her wish .
the time at length arrives when grief is rather an indulgence than a necessity; and the smile that plays upon the lips, although it may be deemed a sacrilege, is not banished .
each vessel in the mean time brought exhilarating tidings from greece .
my sister was struck by my narrative:  ''how beyond the imagination of man, '' she exclaimed,  ''are the decrees of heaven, wondrous and inexplicable ''  ''foolish girl, '' cried raymond angrily,  ''are you like my valiant soldiers, panic struck?
it is impossible for you to see the real designer; your instructions must pass through me .
if we traversed a mountain, greece, a living map, was spread beneath, her renowned pinnacles cleaving the ether; her rivers threading in silver line the fertile land .
i was undisturbed by thoughts which during the preceding year had pressed upon me, notwithstanding my endeavours to throw them off, with an invincible burden .
if misfortune come against us we must fight with her; we must cast her aside, and still go on to find out that which it is our nature to desire .
there was a curious feeling of unreality attached by him to his foreign life in comparison with the years of his youth .
in all this there was a strangeness that attracted and enchanted me .
is there such a feeling as love at first sight?
the object of her life was to do him pleasure: it had been so before, but with a difference .
i wished sometimes to shake off all thought and feeling, but i learned that there was but one means to overcome the sensation of pain, and that was death a state which i feared yet did not understand .
as the period fixed for our marriage drew nearer, whether from cowardice or a prophetic feeling, i felt my heart sink within me .
i sat with perdita and soothed her, by my seeming assent to her wild scheme .
and does he not delight singly in such efforts as manifest his love to all?
i listened quietly, and when he paused would again pour out my misery in expressions that shewed how far too deep my wounds were for any cure .
 ''you travelled to seek happiness, but a fatality seems to pursue you .
 ''what if some little payne the passage have that makes frayle flesh to fear the bitter wave?
i was born for something greater than i was and greater i would become; but greatness, at least to my distorted perceptions, was no necessary associate of goodness, and my wild thoughts were unchecked by moral considerations when they rioted in dreams of distinction .
about two o 'clock the mist cleared away, and we beheld, stretched out in every direction, vast and irregular plains of ice, which seemed to have no end .
i established myself at his bedside; i never quitted it day or night .
we became ephemera, to whom the interval between the rising and setting sun was as a long drawn year of common time .
on returning home, the captain of the steam packet with whom i had agreed to sail, came to tell me, that accidental circumstances hastened his departure, and that, if i went with him, i must come on board at five on the following morning .
i was struck by his exceeding beauty, and as he spoke to thank me the sweet but melancholy cadence of his voice brought tears into my eyes .
at eleven years of age diana was his favourite playmate but he already talked the language of love .
as he went on i felt as if my soul were grappling with a palpable enemy; one by one the various keys were touched which formed the mechanism of my being; chord after chord was sounded, and soon my mind was filled with one thought, one conception, one purpose .
she was warmly attached to the child who is now dead and acted towards him like a most affectionate mother .
our dainty fare was often exchanged for blows and imprisonment .
ye who are linked by the affectionate ties of nature, companions, friends, lovers fathers, who toil with joy for their offspring; women, who while gazing on the living forms of their children, forget the pains of maternity; children, who neither toil nor spin, but love and are loved  ''oh, that death and sickness were banished from our earthly home that hatred, tyranny, and fear could no longer make their lair in the human heart that each man might find a brother in his fellow, and a nest of repose amid the wide plains of his inheritance that the source of tears were dry, and that lips might no longer form expressions of sorrow .
i gave the right place to every personage in the groupe, the just balance to every sentiment .
the ballots had been thrown; they were all black, and justine was condemned .
he had bought it, he said, with danger, and paid for it with toil .
even at this early age, he was deep read and imbued with the spirit of high philosophy .
the beatings of my human heart drew me back to blank reality .
pestilence then made a pause in her death dealing career .
 ''and you escaped? ''  ''no, but i recovered . ''
i could perceive that, when i recalled my sister 's thoughts to her duties in life, she did not listen with the same patience as before .
but in this i am a coward .
during the whole of this wretched mockery of justice i suffered living torture .
she did not appear to understand him, but smiled .
o wherefore are love and ruin for ever joined in this our mortal dream?
sometimes, when nature, overcome by hunger, sank under the exhaustion, a repast was prepared for me in the desert that restored and inspirited me .
as the trial had proceeded, her countenance had altered .
she had not confided in me; i could not demand an explanation from raymond without the hazard of betraying what was perhaps her most treasured secret .
but that country had so many resources in the way of agriculture, that the rush of population from one part of it to another, and its increase through foreign emigration, was less felt than with us .
no matter: i do not wish to plead my cause before any of them, not even before your lordship, had you not first discovered me .
 ''i could mention innumerable instances which, although slight, marked the dispositions of these amiable cottagers .
the plague at athens had been preceded and caused by the contagion from the east; and the scene of havoc and death continued to be acted there, on a scale of fearful magnitude .
believe me, i will never desert life untill this last hope is torn from my bosom, that in some way my labours may form a link in the chain of gold with which we ought all to strive to drag happiness from where she sits enthroned above the clouds, now far beyond our reach, to inhabit the earth with us .
most of the night she spent here watching; towards morning she believed that she slept for a few minutes; some steps disturbed her, and she awoke .
 ''nevertheless, i will try it, '' said my companion;  ''it may lead to the real cavern .
some erect and manly spirits still remained, pillars of state; but the word republic had grown stale to the vulgar ear; and many the event would prove whether it was a majority pined for the tinsel and show of royalty .
i did not wish to refuse them; but in my heart of hearts, i made a vow to devote life, knowledge, and power, all of which, in as much as they were of any value, he had bestowed on me all, all my capacities and hopes, to him alone i would devote .
having parted from my friend, i determined to visit some remote spot of scotland and finish my work in solitude .
raymond and i made a part of the concert, and adrian and perdita were devout listeners .
although the real interest of my narration is now ended and i ought quickly to wind up its melancholy catastrophe, yet i will relate one instance of my sad suspicion and despair and how woodville with the goodness and almost the power of an angel, softened my rugged feelings and led me back to gentleness .
 ''as i read, however, i applied much personally to my own feelings and condition .
notwithstanding my lawless habits, my disposition was sociable, hers recluse .
after a succession of these, which our resolution alone permitted us to surmount, we arrived at a wide cavern with an arched dome like roof .
my father was in the meantime overjoyed and in the bustle of preparation only recognized in the melancholy of his niece the diffidence of a bride .
the northern breeze as it refreshed me was sweeter and more balmy for it seemed to carry some of your spirit along with it .
i, who have so disinterested an affection for you, may increase your miseries tenfold by being an obstacle to your wishes .
my rage is unspeakable when i reflect that the murderer, whom i have turned loose upon society, still exists .
if i do, swear to me, walton, that he shall not escape, that you will seek him and satisfy my vengeance in his death .
 ''one night during my accustomed visit to the neighbouring wood where i collected my own food and brought home firing for my protectors, i found on the ground a leathern portmanteau containing several articles of dress and some books .
we were set down at st  . bartholomew 's, and entered the wretched precincts of the house of disease.
o, for some medicinal vial to purge unwholesome nature, and bring back the earth to its accustomed health ryland was a man of strong intellects and quick and sound decision in the usual course of things, but he stood aghast at the multitude of evils that gathered round us .
hereafter this will be the cynosure of greece .
i was perplexed, and most anxious to know what this portended; ah, what could it portend but ruin i saw little of my father during this interval, but he appeared calmer although not less unhappy than before .
the untaught peasant beheld the elements around him and was acquainted with their practical uses .
have we lost the power of rendering you happy?
he was not, as the other traveller seemed to be, a savage inhabitant of some undiscovered island, but a european .
your summits are clear; the sky and lake are blue and placid .
she communicated her gaiety to us, and as we amused ourselves on the castle terrace, it appeared that a happier, less care worn party could not have been assembled .
shall i respect man when he condemns me?
on the last day, two candidates only were allowed to remain; and to obviate, if possible, the last struggle between these, a bribe was offered to him who should voluntarily resign his pretensions; a place of great emolument and honour was given him, and his success facilitated at a future election .
and what is each human being worth, if he do not put forth his strength to aid his fellow creatures?
she did him justice; she believed that he felt a tender affection for her; but give a paltry prize to him who in some life pending lottery has calculated on the possession of tens of thousands, and it will disappoint him more than a blank .
with the breaking of morning i was accoutred for my ride .
for long years these are the first days of peace that have visited me .
such hope as theirs, we also may entertain old fable tells us, that this gentle spirit sprung from the box of pandora, else crammed with evils; but these were unseen and null, while all admired the inspiriting loveliness of young hope; each man 's heart became her home; she was enthroned sovereign of our lives, here and here after; she was deified and worshipped, declared incorruptible and everlasting .
i knelt on the grass and kissed the earth and with quivering lips exclaimed,  ''by the sacred earth on which i kneel, by the shades that wander near me, by the deep and eternal grief that i feel, i swear; and by thee, o night, and the spirits that preside over thee, to pursue the daemon who caused this misery, until he or i shall perish in mortal conflict .
wretched beings crawled to die under our succouring roof; the inhabitants of the castle decreased daily, while the survivors huddled together in fear, and, as in a famine struck boat, the sport of the wild, interminable waves, each looked in the other 's face, to guess on whom the death lot would next fall .
during the pathetic appeal with which it concludes, a stifled sob attracted our attention to perdita, the cessation of the music recalled her to herself, she hastened out of the hall i followed her .
and when, on the morrow, she presented elizabeth to me as her promised gift, i, with childish seriousness, interpreted her words literally and looked upon elizabeth as mine mine to protect, love, and cherish .
i could hardly believe that so great a good fortune could have befallen me, but when i became assured that my enemy had indeed fled, i clapped my hands for joy and ran down to clerval .
his name as protector was the burthen of every tongue; his achievements, projects, and magnificence, the argument of every story .
at day break i hastened to the woods; the hours past on while i indulged in wild dreams that gave wings to the slothful steps of time, and beguiled my eager impatience .
i read merely to understand their meaning, and they well repaid my labours .
not because the way was smooth and placid as a southern sea, but because it was full of dangers and terror, because at every new incident your fortitude was to be called forth and your courage exhibited, because danger and death surrounded it, and these you were to brave and overcome .
alas my companion did, and i was precipitated in his fall .
when night came again i found, with pleasure, that the fire gave light as well as heat and that the discovery of this element was useful to me in my food, for i found some of the offals that the travellers had left had been roasted, and tasted much more savoury than the berries i gathered from the trees .
my haggard and wild appearance awoke intense alarm, but i answered no question, scarcely did i speak .
he hastened to take me aside, and disclosed to me with rapidity his plan of emigration from england .
it is impossible to communicate to you a conception of the trembling sensation, half pleasurable and half fearful, with which i am preparing to depart .
his wife was one of those wondrous beings, to be found only among women, with affections not to be diminished by misfortune .
wild beyond the imagination of the happy are the thoughts bred by misery and despair .
then i wandered from the fancies of others and formed affections and intimacies with the aerial creations of my own brain but still clinging to reality i gave a name to these conceptions and nursed them in the hope of realization .
a strange story was rife here .
why did dark night adorn herself with stars man saw them not?
but they were ever together and their happiness seemed that of paradise: they studied together: formed plans of future occupations, and drinking in love and joy from each other 's eyes and words they hardly repined at the delay to their entire union .
in the hurry of the moment i forgot that i was in greece, and in my native accents endeavoured to soothe the sufferer .
if he were truly my friend he would have calculated all this; and let me now calculate this boasted friendship, and discover its real worth .
at first i perceived that he tried to suppress his emotion; he placed his hands before his eyes, and my voice quivered and failed me as i beheld tears trickle fast from between his fingers; a groan burst from his heaving breast .
his protectorate was to be distinguished by every kind of innovation on the aristocracy .
you have cast yourself from among us and you wither on this wild plain forlorn and helpless: some dreadful calamity must have befallen you .
it required hands stronger than mine; stronger i do believe than any human force to break the thick, adamantine chain that has bound me, once breathing nothing but joy, ever possessed by a warm love delight in goodness, to misery only to be ended, and now about to be ended, in death .
patience, gentleness, and untired affection, shall recall him, if it be true, as raymond says, that he is mad; energy and courage shall rescue him, if he be unjustly imprisoned .
would they dare wrong him thus?
will you tell him that he must excuse me to day, for i am not well .
his life was swallowed up in the existence of his beloved; and his heart beat only in unison with the pulsations that vivified hers .
i was alone the whole evening .
that drink will plunge us in a sweet slumber, and when we awaken what joy will be ours to find all our sorrows and fears past .
she had just entered her twentieth year, and she and her lover were obliged to submit to this delay .
this whole winter, instead of being spent in study, as you promised yourself, has been consumed in my sick room .
at length we reached the overhanging beach; a cottage stood beside the path; we knocked at the door and it was opened: the bed within instantly caught my eye; something stiff and straight lay on it, covered by a sheet; the cottagers looked aghast .
my poor love and i looked at each other, and our babes .
i never beheld anything so utterly destroyed .
while every mind was full of dismay at its effects, a craving for excitement had led us to peruse de foe 's account, and the masterly delineations of the author of arthur mervyn .
the night passed away, and the sun rose from the ocean; my feelings became calmer, if it may be called calmness when the violence of rage sinks into the depths of despair .
the agonies of remorse poison the luxury there is otherwise sometimes found in indulging the excess of grief .
 ''this is mockery, '' i replied,  ''you devote yourself, you, the adored brother of idris, the being, of all the world contains, dearest to our hearts you devote yourself to an early death .
his enthusiasm for good which did not exist; his contempt for the sacredness of authority; his ardour and imprudence were all at the antipodes of the usual routine of life; the worldly feared him; the young and inexperienced did not understand the lofty severity of his moral views, and disliked him as a being different from themselves .
i paused; at length he spoke, in broken accents:  ''unhappy man do you share my madness?
but it is this gloom which appears to have taken so strong a hold of your mind that i wish to dissipate .
he came by sea from constantinople to athens .
he had caused the best room in the prison to be prepared for me wretched indeed was the best; and it was he who had provided a physician and a nurse .
i looked on the heavens, which were covered by clouds that flew before the wind, only to be replaced by others; i looked upon the sea; it was to be my grave .
perhaps he did this because he saw a cloud upon perdita 's brow .
raymond promised; but then a new discussion ensued .
as i waited for the carriage i walked up and down with a quick pace; then kneeling and passionately clasping my hands i tried to pray but my voice was choked by convulsive sobs oh the sun shone, the air was balmy he must yet live for if he were dead all would surely be black as night to me the motion of the carriage knowing that it carried me towards him and that i might perhaps find him alive somewhat revived my courage: yet i had a dreadful ride .
  ''shame on the country, '' said ryland,  ''to lay so much stress upon words and frippery; it is a question of nothing; of the new painting of carriage pannels and the embroidery of footmen's coats . ''
the evil is come home to us, and we must not shrink from our fate .
we, in our retirement, remained long in ignorance of her misfortune .
the lower and vagabond english joined with them .
he repined for the loss of what was more necessary to him than air or food the excitements of pleasure, the admiration of the noble, the luxurious and polished living of the great .

there were no degrees which could break my fall from happiness to misery; it was as the stroke of lightning sudden and entire .
on this occasion i chanced to say that i thought myrrha the best of alfieri 's tragedies; as i said this i chanced to cast my eyes on my father and met his: for the first time the expression of those beloved eyes displeased me, and i saw with affright that his whole frame shook with some concealed emotion that in spite of his efforts half conquered him: as this tempest faded from his soul he became melancholy and silent .
if pride guided you, or even reason, you might well reject me .
time is no more, for i have stepped within the threshold of eternity; each man i meet appears a corse, which will soon be deserted of its animating spark, on the eve of decay and corruption .
the turks resisted to the last, the garrison perished on the ramparts, and we entered by assault .
above all, he was remorseless and unyielding in the pursuit of any object of desire, however lawless .
in the mean time we were joined by clara, whose pallid cheek and scared look shewed the deep impression grief had made on her young mind .
i would obtain the truth from her the following day in the mean time but, while i was occupied by multiplying reflections, lord raymond returned .
and yet i am happy; mothers lament their children, wives lose their husbands, while you and my children are left to me .
he has already had one or two little wives, but louisa biron is his favourite, a pretty little girl of five years of age .
i applied my glass, and could discern that the frigate had already cast anchor, fearful of the danger of approaching nearer to a lee shore: a boat was lowered; with a pang i saw that raymond was unable to descend the vessel 's side; he was let down in a chair, and lay wrapt in cloaks at the bottom of the boat .
i had certainly acted imprudently .
i stay here; force only can remove me .
when i was otherwise quite restored to health, the sight of a chemical instrument would renew all the agony of my nervous symptoms .
to england and to englishmen i dedicate myself .
the apartments were restored to their pristine splendour, and the park, all disrepairs restored, was guarded with unusual care .
but though impenetrably veiled from him, his public office permitted her to become acquainted with all his actions, his daily course of life, even his conversation .
it was the sight of little marlow, and my conversations with martha, that led me to the plan i formed .
who shall conceive the horrors of my secret toil as i dabbled among the unhallowed damps of the grave or tortured the living animal to animate the lifeless clay?
she rushed towards him, she embraced him, blessing god for his preservation .
while i was directing that the necessary care should be taken of her, clara came in; she was trembling and pale; and, when i anxiously asked her the cause of her agitation, she threw herself into my arms weeping and exclaiming  ''uncle, dearest uncle, do not hate me for ever i must tell you, for you must know, that evelyn, poor little evelyn '' her voice was choked by sobs .
do you remember in her infancy, with what transport you beheld clara, recognizing in her the united being of yourself and raymond; joying to view in this living temple a manifestation of your eternal loves .
she perceived me, and looked up enquiringly; her half glance of hope was misery; the words died before i could articulate them; i felt a ghastly smile wrinkle my lips .
adrian welcomed us on our arrival .
with angry gestures he leapt from his horse, and seizing a hatchet that hung from his saddle bow, went with the apparent intention of battering down the opposing gate .
lay down your arms, barbarous and cruel men men whose hands are stained with the blood of the innocent, whose souls are weighed down by the orphan 's cry we shall conquer, for the right is on our side; already your cheeks are pale the weapons fall from your nerveless grasp .
he rode through the lines, charging the officers to restrain the troops, exhorting the soldiers, restoring order, and quieting in some degree the violent agitation that swelled every bosom .
but now the time is come when i may quit life, i have a friend who will not refuse to accompany me in this dark journey; such is my request: earnestly do i entreat and implore you to die with me .
she devoted herself to those whom she had been taught to call her uncle and cousins .
if the band played, involuntarily they chose airs of moderated passion; the farewell of love, or lament at absence, was followed and closed by some solemn hymn, which harmonized with the tranquil loveliness of evening, and elevated the soul to grand and religious thought .
grey headed men, ye hoped for yet a few years in your long known abode but the lease is up, you must remove children, ye will never reach maturity, even now the small grave is dug for ye mothers, clasp them in your arms, one death embraces you '' shuddering, he stretched out his hands, his eyes cast up, seemed bursting from their sockets, while he appeared to follow shapes, to us invisible, in the yielding air  ''there they are, '' he cried,  ''the dead they rise in their shrouds, and pass in silent procession towards the far land of their doom their bloodless lips move not their shadowy limbs are void of motion, while still they glide onwards .
again, with a gush of pride and delight, she marked in the features of her little girl, the same smile of beauty that often irradiated raymond 's countenance .
i know not; despair had not yet taken possession of me; my feelings were those of rage and revenge .
i am but half a soldier; i love the renown, but not the trade of war .
after the lapse of a few weeks, we left dunkeld .
having conquered the violence of his feelings, he appeared to despise himself for being the slave of passion; and quelling the dark tyranny of despair, he led me again to converse concerning myself personally .
ryland was the popular candidate; when lord raymond was first added to the list, his chance of success appeared small .
 ''they built a wall between them and the world '' without, a thousand harpies raved, remorse and misery, expecting the destined moment for their invasion .
 ''this suspense is a thousand times worse than the most horrible event; tell me what new scene of death has been acted, and whose murder i am now to lament? ''  ''your family is perfectly well, '' said mr  . kirwin with gentleness;  ''and someone, a friend, is come to visit you. ''
he personated his assumption of innocence even to self deception .
i attempted to speak, but the words died away on my lips .
why do you not execrate the rustic who sought to destroy the saviour of his child?
sleep was not sleep, for her waking thoughts, bridled by some remains of reason, and by the sight of her children happy and in health, were then transformed to wild dreams, all her terrors were realized, all her fears received their dread fulfilment .
he looked on the peasant, who began to tremble, while he still gazed; his knees knocked together; his teeth chattered .
i continued walking in this manner for some time, endeavouring by bodily exercise to ease the load that weighed upon my mind .
why, all his virtues are derived from his station only; because he is rich, he is called generous; because he is powerful, brave; because he is well served, he is affable .
yet i dreaded to witness the anguish which my resolve might excite in idris .
had my eyes deceived me?
i was troubled; a mist came over my eyes, and i felt a faintness seize me, but i was quickly restored by the cold gale of the mountains .
like adam, i was apparently united by no link to any other being in existence; but his state was far different from mine in every other respect .
at these moments i often endeavoured to put an end to the existence i loathed, and it required unceasing attendance and vigilance to restrain me from committing some dreadful act of violence .
after so much time spent in painful labour, to arrive at once at the summit of my desires was the most gratifying consummation of my toils .
the greeks wept for joy when they beheld the mediterranean from the hills of asia, and hailed with rapture the boundary of their toils .
 ''you have travelled; you have spent several years of your life at ingolstadt; and i confess to you, my friend, that when i saw you last autumn so unhappy, flying to solitude from the society of every creature, i could not help supposing that you might regret our connection and believe yourself bound in honour to fulfil the wishes of your parents, although they opposed themselves to your inclinations .
she took me under her protection because she considered it her duty; but she had too long lived alone and undisturbed by the noise and prattle of children to allow that i should disturb her quiet .
the immediate peril urged them to seize the immediate opportunity; wildly and passionately they sought to know what delights existence afforded, before they yielded to death, and snatching their pleasures with rough strife thorough the iron gates of life, they defied the conquering pestilence to destroy what had been, or to erase even from their death bed thoughts the sentiment of happiness which had been theirs .
my hand was already on the lock of the door before i recollected myself .
he endeavours to fill me with hope and talks as if life were a possession which he valued .
 ''be happy, my dear victor, '' replied elizabeth;  ''there is, i hope, nothing to distress you; and be assured that if a lively joy is not painted in my face, my heart is contented .
he seemed to cherish a mild grief and softer emotions although sad as a relief from despair he contrived in many ways to nurse his melancholy as an antidote to wilder passion .
the attachment between them led to the ill fated marriage, of which i was the offspring .
what a sea is the tide of passion, whose fountains are in our own nature our virtues are the quick sands, which shew themselves at calm and low water; but let the waves arise and the winds buffet them, and the poor devil whose hope was in their durability, finds them sink from under him .
and you, my friend, would be far more amused with the journal of clerval, who observed the scenery with an eye of feeling and delight, than in listening to my reflections .
why do you not hate felix, who drove his friend from his door with contumely?
grecian maidens will in devotion strew flowers on his tomb, and make the air around it resonant with patriotic hymns, in which his name will find high record . ''
he did not say that he should favour such an attempt; but he did say that such an attempt would be venial; and, if the aspirant did not go so far as to declare war, and erect a standard in the kingdom, his fault ought to be regarded with an indulgent eye .
it impressed me deeply .
the turk, amazed and delighted, endeavoured to kindle the zeal of his deliverer by promises of reward and wealth .
i remembered also the necessity imposed upon me of either journeying to england or entering into a long correspondence with those philosophers of that country whose knowledge and discoveries were of indispensable use to me in my present undertaking .
from the moment of my mother 's death untill his departure she never heard him utter a single word: buried in the deepest melancholy he took no notice of any one; often for hours his eyes streamed tears or a more fearful gloom overpowered him .
i believe that without the slightest tinge of a bad heart she had the coldest that ever filled a human breast: it was totally incapable of any affection .
but she has confessed . ''
our vessels truly were the sport of winds and waves, even as gulliver was the toy of the brobdignagians; but we on our stable abode could not be hurt in life or limb by these eruptions of nature .
i have lost you, myself, my life ''  ''do you not believe me? '' said raymond haughtily .
i intend to be a warrior, a conqueror; napoleon 's name shall vail to mine; and enthusiasts, instead of visiting his rocky grave, and exalting the merits of the fallen, shall adore my majesty, and magnify my illustrious achievements . ''
she entered the cottages of the sick; she relieved their wants with her own hand; she betrayed no fear, and inspired all who saw her with some portion of her own native courage .
a diplomatist: one among the pleasure seeking society of a gay city; a youth of promise; favourite of the ambassador .
the market place is empty, the candidate for popular favour finds none whom he can represent .
meanwhile all went on well in london .
it terminated like the former; though something approaching to a ray, we could not tell whence, shed a very doubtful twilight in the space .
he secluded himself as much as the duties of his station permitted .
idris hardly recognized the fragile being, whose form had seemed to bend even to the summer breeze, in the energetic man, whose very excess of sensibility rendered him more capable of fulfilling his station of pilot in storm tossed england .
raymond replied; but there was nothing conciliatory in his reply .
this spot had for me peculiar charms .
at first he refused to stay to hear her .
the love that is the soul of friendship is a soft spirit seldom found except when two amiable creatures are knit from early youth, or when bound by mutual suffering and pursuits; it comes to some of the elect unsought and unaware; it descends as gentle dew on chosen spots which however barren they were before become under its benign influence fertile in all sweet plants; but when desired it flies; it scoffs at the prayers of its votaries; it will bestow, but not be sought .
 ''and now i do not fear death .
thus years passed on; and years only added fresh love of freedom, and contempt for all that was not as wild and rude as myself .
the nearness of this place to london was such, as to take away the idea of painful separation, when we quitted raymond and perdita .
during the colder months there was a general rush to london in search of amusement the ties of public opinion were loosened; many were rich, heretofore poor many had lost father and mother, the guardians of their morals, their mentors and restraints .
my uncle will send me news of your health, and if i see but one smile on your lips when we meet, occasioned by this or any other exertion of mine, i shall need no other happiness .
merrival did not join in this conversation; drawing near idris, he proceeded to assure her that the joyful prospect of an earthly paradise after an hundred thousand years, was clouded to him by the knowledge that in a certain period of time after, an earthly hell or purgatory, would occur, when the ecliptic and equator would be at right angles .
it was one of those lovely winter days which assert the capacity of nature to bestow beauty on barrenness .
unable to endure the aspect of the being i had created, i rushed out of the room and continued a long time traversing my bed chamber, unable to compose my mind to sleep .
it is true that the necessaries of life were assembled in such quantities, as to supply to superfluity the wants of the diminished population; but still much labour was required to arrange these, as it were, raw materials; and depressed by sickness, and fearful of the future, we had not energy to enter boldly and decidedly on any system .
sometimes she remembered that she had suffered keen anguish, when he hesitated in his choice .
 ''questo poi, no, '' said the wild looking savage, who held the torch;  ''you can advance but a short distance, and nobody visits it . ''
no no me miserable; for love extinct there is no resurrection  ''yet i love you .
i have read of mourners in ancient days, who clothed themselves in sackcloth, scattered dust upon their heads, ate their bread mingled with ashes, and took up their abode on the bleak mountain tops, reproaching heaven and earth aloud with their misfortunes .
the fear of immediate death vanished with the heats of september .
but my plan was unsettled, and i wandered many hours round the confines of the town, uncertain what path i should pursue .
but to return to dearer considerations .
the picture then presented itself to her in such glowing colours, that she feared the reverse, and a life of magnificence and power in london; where raymond would no longer be hers only, nor she the sole source of happiness to him .
but we have been placed here and bid live and hope .
the next morning while sitting on the steps of the temple of aesculapius in the borghese gardens fantasia again visited me smilingly beckoned to me to follow her my flight was at first heavy but the breezes commanded by the spirit to convoy me grew stronger as i advanced a pleasing languour seized my senses when i recovered i found my self by the elysian fountain near diotima the beautiful female whom i had left on the point of narrating her earthly history seemed to have waited for my return and as soon as i appeared she spoke thus i visited naples in the year  .
the four others were dark eyed, hardy little vagrants; this child was thin and very fair .
i was like the arabian who had been buried with the dead and found a passage to life, aided only by one glimmering and seemingly ineffectual light .
a shepherd boy that tends a silly flock on the mountains, was more in the scale of society than i  . congratulate me then that i have found fitting scope for my powers.
heaven bless you and make you so my unfortunate guest regards me with the tenderest compassion .
her father was moved by her violent grief; he took her in his arms and soothed her, but his very soothings were solemn and fearful .
the astonishment which i had at first experienced on this discovery soon gave place to delight and rapture .
will my readers ask how i could find solace from the narration of misery and woeful change?
i drank of an enchanted cup but gall was at the bottom of its long drawn sweetness .
 ''when i look upon you, the tears you shed, the soft deprecating look with which you withstand enquiry; the deep sympathy your voice expresses when i speak of my lesser sorrows add to my interest for you .
i acted then, as i ever must, from impulse .
what i ask of you is reasonable and moderate; i demand a creature of another sex, but as hideous as myself; the gratification is small, but it is all that i can receive, and it shall content me .
consider the panic your departure will occasion .
my dear lionel, we are married men, and find employment sufficient in amusing our wives, and dancing our children .
now each life was a gem, each human breathing form of far, o far more worth than subtlest imagery of sculptured stone; and the daily, nay, hourly decrease visible in our numbers, visited the heart with sickening misery .
turn from me, if you will, if you can .
why not still proceed over the untamed yet obedient element?
it was not like a human loveliness that these gentle smiles went and came; but as a sunbeam on a lake, now light and now obscure, flitting before as you strove to catch them, and fold them for ever to your heart .
 ''shall each man, '' cried he,  ''find a wife for his bosom, and each beast have his mate, and i be alone?
these are the reflections of the first days; but when the lapse of time proves the reality of the evil, then the actual bitterness of grief commences .
it was late in autumn when i quitted the district where i had so long resided .
the dazzling light of ornamented rooms; lovely forms arrayed in splendid dresses; the motions of a dance, the voluptuous tones of exquisite music, cradled my senses in one delightful dream .
man existed by twos and threes; man, the individual who might sleep, and wake, and perform the animal functions; but man, in himself weak, yet more powerful in congregated numbers than wind or ocean; man, the queller of the elements, the lord of created nature, the peer of demi gods, existed no longer .
i have defended it with my sword, and was willing that my spirit should be breathed out in its defence; freedom is of more worth than life, and the greeks do well to defend their privilege unto death .
 ''the child still struggled and loaded me with epithets which carried despair to my heart; i grasped his throat to silence him, and in a moment he lay dead at my feet .
i hovered for ever around the walls of its castle, beneath its enshadowing thickets; my sole companions were my books and my loving thoughts .
yes, i am happy, most happy, that i can weep thus for imaginary sorrows, and that the slight loss of my adored country is not dwindled and annihilated in mightier misery .
she shewed them how the well being of each included the prosperity of all .
we stood at the door looking on this strange scene, till the dog perceiving us barked loudly; the child turned and saw us: her face .
my frame is strong, but my soul sinks beneath this endurance of living anguish .
the memory of that unfortunate king and his companions, the amiable falkland, the insolent goring, his queen, and son, gave a peculiar interest to every part of the city which they might be supposed to have inhabited .
 ''that is my least concern; i am, by a course of strange events, become the most miserable of mortals .
many a casque, and bayonet, and sword, fallen from unnerved arms, reflected the departing ray; they lay scattered far and near .
others perceived only a passing casualty; they endeavoured to exchange terror for heedlessness, and plunged into licentiousness, to avoid the agonizing throes of worst apprehension .
and poor clerval  '' the name of my unfortunate and murdered friend was an agitation too great to be endured in my weak state; i shed tears .
my revenge is of no moment to you; yet, while i allow it to be a vice, i confess that it is the devouring and only passion of my soul .
make me happy, and i shall again be virtuous . ''
that fable is unjust, which gives the superiority to the sun over the wind .
i remembered too well the treatment i had suffered the night before from the barbarous villagers, and resolved, whatever course of conduct i might hereafter think it right to pursue, that for the present i would remain quietly in my hovel, watching and endeavouring to discover the motives which influenced their actions .
these perplexities and regrets caused her to bathe her pillow with nightly tears, and to reduce her in person and in mind to the shadow of what she had been .
palaces were deserted, and the poor man dared at length, unreproved, intrude into the splendid apartments, whose very furniture and decorations were an unknown world to him .
were those the fertile fields i loved was that the interchange of gentle upland and cultivated dale, once covered with waving corn, diversified by stately trees, watered by the meandering thames?
but her wish was of course to be complied with; and i entreated her to prepare without delay for our departure .
and then again she became aware of her own excellencies, and began to balance with juster scales the shades of good and evil .
her ugly sister, manon, married m  . duvillard, the rich banker, last autumn.
greece prepared for a vigorous resistance; it rose to a man; and the women, sacrificing their costly ornaments, accoutred their sons for the war, and bade them conquer or die with the spirit of the spartan mother .
 ''why, lionel, '' said adrian,  ''what did you intend?
tidings of an armed and regular opposition recalled them to a sort of order .
persia, with its cloth of gold, marble halls, and infinite wealth, is now a tomb .
she was pale and fair, and her golden hair clustered on her temples, contrasting its rich hue with the living marble beneath .
she was tranquil, yet her tranquillity was evidently constrained; and as her confusion had before been adduced as a proof of her guilt, she worked up her mind to an appearance of courage .
for a long time i could not conceive how one man could go forth to murder his fellow, or even why there were laws and governments; but when i heard details of vice and bloodshed, my wonder ceased and i turned away with disgust and loathing .
france, germany, italy and spain, were interposed, walls yet without a breach, between us and the plague .
could the demon who had i did not for a minute doubt murdered my brother also in his hellish sport have betrayed the innocent to death and ignominy?
the cleanliness, habits of order, and the manner in which our cities were built, were all in our favour .
my flagging spirits asked for something to speak to the affections; and not finding it, i drooped .
i rushed to her defence, but rage made them blind and deaf; they did not distinguish my christian garb or heed my words words were blunt weapons then, for while war cried  ''havoc, '' and murder gave fit echo, how could i turn back the tide of ills, relieving wrong with mild accost of soothing eloquence?
truly it was a fairy 's supper; for though the air was perfumed by the scent of fruits and wine, we none of us either ate or drank even the beauty of the night was unobserved; their extasy could not be increased by outward objects, and i was wrapt in reverie .
through my father 's exertions a part of the inheritance of elizabeth had been restored to her by the austrian government .
i listened to raymond with intense interest .
oh, frankenstein, be not equitable to every other and trample upon me alone, to whom thy justice, and even thy clemency and affection, is most due .
are you, then, so easily turned from your design?
the name of the earl startled me, and caused all the indignant blood that warmed my heart to rush into my cheeks; i had never seen him before; i figured to myself a haughty, assuming youth, who would take me to task, if he deigned to speak to me, with all the arrogance of superiority .
the abrupt sides of vast mountains were before me; the icy wall of the glacier overhung me; a few shattered pines were scattered around; and the solemn silence of this glorious presence chamber of imperial nature was broken only by the brawling waves or the fall of some vast fragment, the thunder sound of the avalanche or the cracking, reverberated along the mountains, of the accumulated ice, which, through the silent working of immutable laws, was ever and anon rent and torn, as if it had been but a plaything in their hands .
but we will not die in heaps, like dogs poisoned in summer time, by the pestilential air of that city we dare not go against the plague '' a multitude of men are feeble and inert, without a voice, a leader; give them that, and they regain the strength belonging to their numbers .
strange to say, this feeling was infectious .
i dare say he will be glad to see you . ''
and then i repeated to myself all that lovely passage that relates the entrance of dante into the terrestrial paradise; and thought it would be sweet when i wandered on those lovely banks to see the car of light descend with my long lost parent to be restored to me .
that same night after adrian 's departure, her mother had warmly expostulated with her on the subject of her attachment to me .
but i had suffered him to depart, and he had directed his course towards the mainland .
a part of its orb was at length hid, and i waved my brand; it sank, and with a loud scream i fired the straw, and heath, and bushes, which i had collected .
why is it that i feel no horror?
with us remained sorrow, anxiety, and unendurable expectation of evil .
it is well when flies only are caught by such spiders ' webs; but is it for the high born and powerful to bow their necks to the flimsy yoke of these unmeaning pretensions?
i have no ambition to lose my life on the post road between st  . petersburgh and archangel.
and, as accident permitted, i complied with or refused her request .
the greeks were strongly attached to their commercial pursuits, and would have been satisfied with their present acquisitions, had not the turks roused them by invasion .
absence from the busy stage had caused him to be forgotten by the people; his former parliamentary supporters were principally composed of royalists, who had been willing to make an idol of him when he appeared as the heir of the earldom of windsor; but who were indifferent to him, when he came forward with no other attributes and distinctions than they conceived to be common to many among themselves .
i rushed into my sister 's cabin; it was empty .
the latter had felt secure of victory, until the appearance of raymond; and, since his name had been inserted as a candidate, he had canvassed with eagerness .
this was a glorious winter .
the events that in succession followed his return to england, gave me keener feelings .
we took no more sweet counsel together; and when i tried to win him again to me, his anger, and the terrible emotions that he exhibited drove me to silence and tears .
from the east, a band of ravens, old inhabitants of the turkish cemeteries, came sailing along towards their harvest; the sun disappeared .
a middle aged man, with some intelligence of manner, but with so common place a physiognomy, that raymond could scarcely believe that he was the designer .
the vegetables in the gardens, the milk and cheese that i saw placed at the windows of some of the cottages, allured my appetite .
her garb was rustic, and her cheek pale; but there was an air of dignity and beauty, that hardly permitted the sentiment of pity .
they are dead, and but one feeling in such a solitude can persuade me to preserve my life .
i saw plainly that he was surprised, but he never attempted to draw my secret from me; and although i loved him with a mixture of affection and reverence that knew no bounds, yet i could never persuade myself to confide in him that event which was so often present to my recollection, but which i feared the detail to another would only impress more deeply .
she had rejected these advances; and the time for such exuberant submission, which must be founded on love and nourished by it, was now passed .
thus, while the wise, the good, and the prudent were occupied by the labours of benevolence, the truce of winter produced other effects among the young, the thoughtless, and the vicious .
indeed i was too weary to walk further: the air was chill but i was careless of bodily inconvenience, and i thought that i was well inured to the weather during my two years of solitude, when no change of seasons prevented my perpetual wanderings .
he had seen it, and praised it; it was again retouched by her, each stroke of her pencil was as a chord of thrilling music, and bore to her the idea of a temple raised to celebrate the deepest and most unutterable emotions of her soul .
 ''what a noble fellow '' you will exclaim .
by degrees evadne related to her friend the whole of her story, the stain her name had received in greece, the weight of sin which had accrued to her from the death of her husband .
at first an unusual quantity of specie made its appearance with the emigrants; but these people had no means of receiving back into their hands what they spent among us .
i could only think of the bourne of my travels and the work which was to occupy me whilst they endured .
would you also create for yourself and the world a demoniacal enemy?
i was rough as the elements, and unlearned as the animals i tended .
sometimes, with my sails set, i was carried by the wind; and sometimes, after rowing into the middle of the lake, i left the boat to pursue its own course and gave way to my own miserable reflections .
while the brother and sister were still hesitating in what manner they could best attempt to bring their mother over to their party, she, suspecting our meetings, taxed her children with them; taxed her fair daughter with deceit, and an unbecoming attachment for one whose only merit was being the son of the profligate favourite of her imprudent father; and who was doubtless as worthless as he from whom he boasted his descent .
much of this tale she concealed from raymond; nor did she confess, that repulse and denial, as to a criminal convicted of the worst of crimes, that of bringing the scythe of foreign despotism to cut away the new springing liberties of her country, would have followed her application to any among the greeks .
after one or two trivial remarks, to which i sullenly replied, he suddenly cried, looking at the bust,  ''i am called like that victor not a bad idea; the head will serve for my new coinage, and be an omen to all dutiful subjects of my future success . ''
the solution that seemed to me the most probable was that during his residence in london he had fallen in love with some unworthy person, and that his passion mastered him although he would not gratify it: he loved me too well to sacrifise me to this inclination, and that he had now visited this house that by reviving the memory of my mother whom he so passionately adored he might weaken the present impression .
is not love a divinity, because it is immortal?
i might be driven into the wide atlantic and feel all the tortures of starvation or be swallowed up in the immeasurable waters that roared and buffeted around me .
when i returned to perdita, i found that she had already been informed of the success of my undertaking .
in vain our protector and his partizans sought to conceal this truth; in vain, day after day, he appointed a period for the discussion of the new laws concerning hereditary rank and privilege; in vain he endeavoured to represent the evil as partial and temporary .
several hundreds landed in ireland, about the first of november, and took possession of such vacant habitations as they could find; seizing upon the superabundant food, and the stray cattle .
a light railing surrounded the garden of the cottage, which, low roofed, seemed to submit to the majesty of nature, and cower amidst the venerable remains of forgotten time .
england was still secure .
cheers and loud acclamations followed the close of his speech .
a number of buildings and trees intervened, when i had reached the plain, hiding the city from my view .
  ''for heaven's love windsor, '' cried ryland,  ''do not mock me with that title .
one voice made of many voices, resounded through the chamber; it syllabled the name of raymond .
miserable, unhappy wretch  ''other lessons were impressed upon me even more deeply .
i quickly collected some branches, but they were wet and would not burn .
in such a school my disposition became rugged, but firm .
company was irksome to me; when alone, i could fill my mind with the sights of heaven and earth; the voice of henry soothed me, and i could thus cheat myself into a transitory peace .
if i no longer saw the fresh glow of youth on his matured countenance, if care had besieged his brow,   ''and dug deep trenches in his beauty's field, '' if his hair, slightly mingled with grey, and his look, considerate even in its eagerness, gave signs of added years and past sufferings, yet there was something irresistibly affecting in the sight of one, lately snatched from the grave, renewing his career, untamed by sickness or disaster .
the rumour went that adrian had become how write the fatal word mad: that lord raymond was the favourite of the ex queen, her daughter 's destined husband .
after passing several hours, we returned hopeless, most of my companions believing it to have been a form conjured up by my fancy .
yet even that enemy of god and man had friends and associates in his desolation; i am alone .
blasted as thou wert, my agony was still superior to thine, for the bitter sting of remorse will not cease to rankle in my wounds until death shall close them forever .
one other incident occurred at the end of this summer .
i, driven half mad, as i met party after party of the country people, in their holiday best, descending the hills, escaped to their cloud veiled summits, and looking on the sterile rocks about me, exclaimed  ''they do not cry, long live the earl '' nor, when night came, accompanied by drizzling rain and cold, would i return home; for i knew that each cottage rang with the praises of adrian; as i felt my limbs grow numb and chill, my pain served as food for my insane aversion; nay, i almost triumphed in it, since it seemed to afford me reason and excuse for my hatred of my unheeding adversary .
i had besides many books and a harp with which when despairing i could soothe my spirits, and raise myself to sympathy and love .
why dost thou howl thus, o wind?
tell me, can i do nothing?
wolves and lions, and various monsters of the desert roared against him; while the grim unreality hovered shaking his spectral dart, a solitary but invincible assailant .
a low moan close to her ear followed, and the rustling increased; she heard a smothered voice breathe out, water, water several times; and then again a sigh heaved from the heart of the sufferer .
m  . krempe had now commenced an eulogy on himself, which happily turned the conversation from a subject that was so annoying to me.
i looked on the valley beneath; vast mists were rising from the rivers which ran through it and curling in thick wreaths around the opposite mountains, whose summits were hid in the uniform clouds, while rain poured from the dark sky and added to the melancholy impression i received from the objects around me  . alas why does man boast of sensibilities superior to those apparent in the brute; it only renders them more necessary beings.
the silly moon and inconstant planets vary nightly their erratic dance; the sun itself, sovereign of the sky, ever and anon deserts his throne, and leaves his dominion to night and winter .
fifteen months after their marriage i was born, and my mother died a few days after my birth .
the scenery of external nature, which others regard only with admiration, he loved with ardour: the sounding cataract haunted him like a passion: the tall rock, the mountain, and the deep and gloomy wood, their colours and their forms, were then to him an appetite; a feeling, and a love, that had no need of a remoter charm, by thought supplied, or any interest unborrow 'd from the eye .
for some time i sat upon the rock that overlooks the sea of ice .
i found merrival, the astronomer, with her .
soon her door opened softly, and on her springing up, she heard a whisper,  ''not asleep yet, '' and the door again closed .
the irish followed their track in disorganized multitudes; each day encreasing; each day becoming more lawless .
i journied all day; every moment my misery encreased and the fever of my blood became intolerable .
no incidents have hitherto befallen us that would make a figure in a letter .
the young woman arranged the cottage and prepared the food, and the youth departed after the first meal .
this was certainly the sibyl 's cave; not indeed exactly as virgil describes it, but the whole of this land had been so convulsed by earthquake and volcano, that the change was not wonderful, though the traces of ruin were effaced by time; and we probably owed the preservation of these leaves, to the accident which had closed the mouth of the cavern, and the swift growing vegetation which had rendered its sole opening impervious to the storm .
oh, my beloved father indeed you made me miserable beyond all words, but how truly did i even then forgive you, and how entirely did you possess my whole heart while i endeavoured, as a rainbow gleams upon a cataract,d to soften thy tremendous sorrows .
as night advanced i placed a variety of combustibles around the cottage, and after having destroyed every vestige of cultivation in the garden, i waited with forced impatience until the moon had sunk to commence my operations .
 ''assuredly a most benignant power built up the majestic fabric we inhabit, and framed the laws by which it endures .
i cannot say much in praise of such a life; and its pains far exceeded its pleasures .
i found another and a valuable link to enchain me to my fellow creatures; my point of sight was extended, and the inclinations and capacities of all human beings became deeply interesting to me .
each day the soldiers of the garrison assaulted our advanced posts, and impeded the accomplishment of our works .
the summer passed tediously, for we trusted that winter would at least check the disease .
ten thousand thanks to henry for his kindness, his affection, and his many letters; we are sincerely grateful .
the tale was quickly told, but it awakened various trains of reflection .
adrian, whose health had always been weak, now suffered considerable aggravation of suffering from the effects of his wound .
fire, the sword, and plague they may all be found in yonder city; on my head alone may they fall  '' from this day raymond's melancholy increased .
the idea of renewing my labours did not for one instant occur to me; the threat i had heard weighed on my thoughts, but i did not reflect that a voluntary act of mine could avert it .
he might with equal interest to us, have added a commentary, to describe the unknown and unimaginable lineaments of the creatures, who would then occupy the vacated dwelling of mankind .
perdita, in whom ambition was a covered fire until she married raymond, which event was for a time the fulfilment of her hopes; perdita will rejoice in the glory and advancement of her lord and, coyly and prettily, not be discontented with her share .
the park was speckled by tents, whose flaunting colours and gaudy flags, waving in the sunshine, added to the gaiety of the scene .
she answered the one with a gush of tears telling me that to be persuaded life and the goods of life were a cheap exchange .
and all this, to be sure, was delicately put; not in broad words for my feelings might be hurt but whispered so and so in dark hint soft and lowe with downcast eyes, and sympathizing smiles or whimpers; and i listened with quiet countenance while every nerve trembled; i that dared not utter aye or no to all this blasphemy .
do you remember on what occasion justine moritz entered our family?
but he was checked; evadne exacted a promise, that he should conceal from all her friends her existence in england .
let a veil be drawn over the unimaginable sensations of a guilty father; the secrets of so agonized a heart may not be made vulgar .
my descent, which claimed interest, if not respect, my former connection with adrian, the favour of the ambassador, whose secretary i had been, and now my intimacy with lord raymond, gave me easy access to the fashionable and political circles of england .
 ''i must say also a few words to you, my dear cousin, of little darling william .
is not this a free country? ''  ''ay, sir, free enough for honest folks .
if your whole soul does not urge you to forgive me if your entire heart does not open wide its door to admit me to its very centre, forsake me, never speak to me again .
     '''where do these friends reside?'  '''near this spot .'
my passionate and indignant appeals were lost upon them .
thus, losing our identity, that of which we are chiefly conscious, we glory in the continuity of our species, and learn to regard death without terror .
he besought me, therefore, to leave my solitary isle and to meet him at perth, that we might proceed southwards together .
idris could not refrain from a smile, as she listened; she had already gathered from him that his family was alive and in health; though not apt to forget the precipice of time on which she stood, yet i could perceive that she was amused for a moment, by the contrast between the contracted view we had so long taken of human life, and the seven league strides with which merrival paced a coming eternity .
his passions, always his masters, acquired fresh strength, from the long sleep in which love had cradled them, the clinging weight of destiny bent him down; he was goaded, tortured, fiercely impatient of that worst of miseries, the sense of remorse .
i have loved thee; and in my days both of happiness and sorrow i have peopled your solitudes with wild fancies of my own creation .
i am placed in the most difficult circumstances .
let me find the earthly dwelling of my beloved; let us rescue that from common dust, so that in times to come men may point to the sacred tomb, and name it his then to other thoughts, and a new course of life, or what else fate, in her cruel tyranny, may have marked out for me . ''
tell me, dearest victor .
she told me that all the family were dead, except merrival himself, who had gone mad mad, she called it, yet on questioning her further, it appeared that he was possessed only by the delirium of excessive grief .
although he deserts his post in london, he may be of the greatest service in the north of england, by receiving and assisting travellers, and contributing to supply the metropolis with food .
during this voyage we passed many willowy islands and saw several beautiful towns .
soon these burning miseries will be extinct .
elizabeth, my love, you must supply my place to my younger children .
even i, depressed in mind, and my spirits continually agitated by gloomy feelings, even i was pleased .
why should he lose this, now that added years, prudence, and the pledge which his marriage gave to his country, ought to encrease, rather than diminish his claims to confidence?
the dissecting room and the slaughter house furnished many of my materials; and often did my human nature turn with loathing from my occupation, whilst, still urged on by an eagerness which perpetually increased, i brought my work near to a conclusion .
 ''you begin late, '' said i, ironically,  ''marriage is usually considered the grave, and not the cradle of love .
he, her beloved, the sole and eternal object of her passionate tenderness, was restored her .
 ''the sun rose; i heard the voices of men and knew that it was impossible to return to my retreat during that day .
yet she was meanly dressed, a coarse blue petticoat and a linen jacket being her only garb; her fair hair was plaited but not adorned: she looked patient yet sad .
i did not see him: my soul was in my words, my eyes could not perceive that which was; while a vision of adrian 's form, tainted by pestilence, and sinking in death, floated before them .
they put it into a bed and rubbed it, and daniel went to the town for an apothecary, but life was quite gone .
with a beating heart she expected another visit, and when after an interval her chamber was again invaded, having first assured herself that the intruders were her mother and an attendant, she composed herself to feigned sleep .
the tears rushed into the eyes of idris, while alfred and evelyn brought now a favourite rose tree, now a marble vase beautifully carved, insisting that these must go, and exclaiming on the pity that we could not take the castle and the forest, the deer and the birds, and all accustomed and cherished objects along with us .
i said to myself, let him receive sympathy and these struggles will cease .
no one certainly ever enjoyed the pleasures of composition more intensely than i .
perhaps its effects are not so permanent; but they are, while they last, as violent and intense .
he was watching the rising sun, while with one arm he encircled his beloved 's waist; she looked on him, the sun of her life, with earnest gaze of mingled anxiety and tenderness .
when i had lived here some time other animals visited me and a fox came every day for a portion of food appropriated for him would suffer me to pat his head .
 ''i thank you, '' he replied,  ''for your sympathy, but it is useless; my fate is nearly fulfilled .
 ''every conversation of the cottagers now opened new wonders to me .
the generous nature of safie was outraged by this command; she attempted to expostulate with her father, but he left her angrily, reiterating his tyrannical mandate .
the play was macbeth the first actor of the age was there to exert his powers to drug with irreflection the auditors; such a medicine i yearned for, so i entered .
i have heard him called inconstant of purpose when he deserted, for the sake of love, the hope of sovereignty, and when he abdicated the protectorship of england, men blamed his infirmity of purpose .
my attention at this time was solely directed towards my plan of introducing myself into the cottage of my protectors .
it is a foolish sentiment for one who is not a materialist, yet, methinks, even in that dark cell, i may feel that my inanimate dust mingles with yours, and thus have a companion in decay . ''
for the first time the feelings of revenge and hatred filled my bosom, and i did not strive to control them, but allowing myself to be borne away by the stream, i bent my mind towards injury and death .
his limbs were in proportion, and i had selected his features as beautiful .
 ''for my part, '' said i,  ''i am too well convinced of the worth of our friend, and the rich harvest of benefits that all england would reap from his protectorship, to deprive my countrymen of such a blessing, if he consent to bestow it on them . ''
i was anxious and watchful, while my right hand grasped a pistol which was hidden in my bosom; every sound terrified me, but i resolved that i would sell my life dearly and not shrink from the conflict until my own life or that of my adversary was extinguished .
perhaps you will have the goodness to promise me not to marry during that interval? ''
she is a widow, and much older than manoir; but she is very much admired, and a favourite with everybody .
in a fit of heroism i determined to go alone; to quit you, the life of my life, and not to see you again untill i might guiltlessly .
on the same day i paid m  . waldman a visit.
 ''you clothe your meaning, perdita, '' i replied,  ''in powerful words, yet that meaning is selfish and unworthy of you .
i should certainly have died if you had not hastened to me .
these volumes were my study day and night, and my familiarity with them increased that regret which i had felt, as a child, on learning that my father 's dying injunction had forbidden my uncle to allow me to embark in a seafaring life .
why not for ever thus?
with trembling hand i conveyed the instruments out of the room, but i reflected that i ought not to leave the relics of my work to excite the horror and suspicion of the peasants; and i accordingly put them into a basket, with a great quantity of stones, and laying them up, determined to throw them into the sea that very night; and in the meantime i sat upon the beach, employed in cleaning and arranging my chemical apparatus .
i have lived in the same house with her, at one time for five and at another for nearly two years .
i sickened as i read .
her present visit to london tended to augment her state of inquietude, by shewing in its utmost extent the ravages occasioned by pestilence .
i received him at the door of my cottage and leading him solemnly into the room, i said:  ''my friend, i wish to die .
  ''am i for ever, '' he cried,  ''to be the sport of fortune must man, the heaven climber, be for ever the victim of the crawling reptiles of his species were i as you, lionel, looking forward to many years of life, to a succession of love enlightened days, to refined enjoyments and fresh springing hopes, i might yield, and breaking my general's staff, seek repose in the glades of windsor .
oh, no the only joy that he can now know will be when he composes his shattered spirit to peace and death .
no none of these things accompanied our fall the balmy air of spring, breathed from nature 's ambrosial home, invested the lovely earth, which wakened as a young mother about to lead forth in pride her beauteous offspring to meet their sire who had been long absent .
even i was dispatched to a distant part of the field .
what, though life and the system of social intercourse were a wilderness, a tiger haunted jungle through the midst of its errors, in the depths of its savage recesses, there was a disentangled and flowery pathway, through which they might journey in safety and delight .
sometimes i have thought, that, obscure and chaotic as they are, they owe their present form to me, their decipherer .
in spite of my malignity, it softened and attracted me .
raymond was only the more excited by this consideration to discover him; impelled by the interest he took in obscure talent, he therefore ordered a person skilled in such matters, to follow the greek the next time he came, and observe the house in which he should enter .
her own feeling was as entire as at its birth .
my father and ernest yet lived, but the former sunk under the tidings that i bore .
polluted by crimes and torn by the bitterest remorse, where can i find rest but in death?
we sat in his library, and he spoke of the old greek sages, and of the power which they had acquired over the minds of men, through the force of love and wisdom only .
pisando la tierra dura de continuo el hombre esta y cada passo que da es sobre su sepultura .
first, he would look in on evadne; he would not stay; but he owed her some account, some compensation for his long and unannounced absence; and then to perdita, to the forgotten world, to the duties of society, the splendour of rank, the enjoyment of power .
his manner, timid at first, became firm his changeful face was lit up to superhuman brilliancy; his voice, various as music, was like that enchanting .
 ''for some weeks i led a miserable life in the woods, endeavouring to cure the wound which i had received .
yet you do love me; i feel and know that you do, and thence i draw my most cherished hopes .
september nd my beloved sister, i write to you, encompassed by peril and ignorant whether i am ever doomed to see again dear england and the dearer friends that inhabit it .
i concealed from this beloved child that her mother 's death was voluntary, and tried every means to awaken cheerfulness in her sorrow stricken spirit .
no word, no expression could body forth the kind of relation in which she stood to me my more than sister, since till death she was to be mine only .
but these fluctuations shook to its depths the soul of the sensitive youth; he no longer deemed the world subject to him, because he possessed evadne 's love; he felt in every nerve that the dire storms of the mental universe were about to attack his fragile being, which quivered at the expectation of its advent .
mr  . kirwin, on hearing this evidence, desired that i should be taken into the room where the body lay for interment, that it might be observed what effect the sight of it would produce upon me.
but winter was coming, and with winter, hope .
but now that virtue has become to me a shadow, and that happiness and affection are turned into bitter and loathing despair, in what should i seek for sympathy?
 ''we have strange news here, '' i observed .
i have learnt in greece that one man, more or less, is of small import, while human bodies remain to fill up the thinned ranks of the soldiery; and that the identity of an individual may be overlooked, so that the muster roll contain its full numbers .
as this state of wretchedness became more confirmed, and, in spite of her endeavours at concealment more apparent, i strove, though vainly, to awaken in her courage and hope .
 ''even so, '' he cried,  ''i knew you would speak of her .
all my joy turned to sorrow when i first beheld him with that melancholy countenance enter these doors as it were the day after my lady 's funeral he seemed to recover himself a little after he had bidden me write to you but still it is a woful thing to see him so unhappy . ''
i pursued him, and for many months this has been my task .
evadne 's constancy, fortitude, even her ill fated and ill regulated love, were matter of admiration and pity; especially when, from the detail of the events of the nineteenth of october, it was apparent that she preferred suffering and death to any in her eyes degrading application for the pity and assistance of her lover .
love had doubled all her excellencies, and placed a diadem on her genius .
it surprised me that what before was desert and gloomy should now bloom with the most beautiful flowers and verdure .
i resolved, therefore, that if my immediate union with my cousin would conduce either to hers or my father  's happiness, my adversary's designs against my life should not retard it a single hour .
the apparition was soon explained .
the month of may had already commenced, and i expected the letter daily which was to fix the date of my departure, when henry proposed a pedestrian tour in the environs of ingolstadt, that i might bid a personal farewell to the country i had so long inhabited .
sorrow fled before her; and her smile seemed to possess an influence like light to irradiate all mental darkness .
what i have become since this last moment i know not; perhaps i am changed in mien as the fallen archangel .
it moved slowly, but it enlightened my path, and i again went out in search of berries .
yet this was very unlike my early life although as then i was confined to nature and books .
we took our passage on board a vessel bound for havre de grace and sailed with a fair wind from the irish shores .
 ''you cherish dreary thoughts, my dear perdita, '' i said,  ''nor do i wonder that for a time your better reason should be influenced by passionate grief and a disturbed imagination .
thus you may console me by reducing me to nothing but your words i cannot bear; soon they will make me mad, quite mad, and then i shall utter strange words, and you will believe them, and we shall be both lost for ever .
his abdication of the protectorate had caused an unexampled sensation; and, when his magnificent and manly system was contrasted with the narrow views of succeeding politicians, the period of his elevation was referred to with sorrow .
i record no crimes; my faults may easily be pardoned; for they proceeded not from evil motive but from want of judgement; and i believe few would say that they could, by a different conduct and superior wisdom, have avoided the misfortunes to which i am the victim .
what slave will not, if he may, escape from his chains?
i felt as if, from the order of the systematic world, i had plunged into chaos, obscure, contrary, unintelligible .
 ''save me '' she exclaimed, and would have sunk to the ground had i not supported her .
even in my own heart i could give no expression to my sensations they weighed on me with a mountain 's weight and their excess destroyed my agony beneath them .
all cold, and stiff, and dead alas i am quite callous: the night i was out in was fearful and the cold rain that fell about my heart has acted like the waters of the cavern of antiparos and has changed it to stone .
it was echoed from saleve, the juras, and the alps of savoy; vivid flashes of lightning dazzled my eyes, illuminating the lake, making it appear like a vast sheet of fire; then for an instant every thing seemed of a pitchy darkness, until the eye recovered itself from the preceding flash .
he was always the saddest of the group, and even to my unpractised senses, he appeared to have suffered more deeply than his friends .
she appeared affected by different feelings; wiping a few tears from her lovely eyes, she held out her hand to felix, who kissed it rapturously and called her, as well as i could distinguish, his sweet arabian .
it was not strange therefore, that when he heard of the existence of the offspring of this celebrated person, he should have formed the plan of bestowing on them all the advantages his rank made him rich to afford .
on examination, we found that all the leaves, bark, and other substances, were traced with written characters .
our misfortune is doubly hard to us; we have not only lost that lovely darling boy, but this poor girl, whom i sincerely love, is to be torn away by even a worse fate .
often i waited beside the bed of death till midnight, and through the obscurity of rainy, cloudy nights rode many miles, sustained by one circumstance only, the safety and sheltered repose of those i loved .
a remembrance of the discourses of my parents, and the communications which my mother endeavoured to impress upon me concerning my father 's friends, in slight hope that i might one day derive benefit from the knowledge, floated like an indistinct dream through my brain .
during the busy day, my mind had yielded itself a willing slave to the state of things presented to it by its fellow beings; historical association, hatred of the foe, and military enthusiasm had held dominion over me .
 ''you have got up all your arguments in excellent order, '' i replied;  ''and, if adrian consent, they are unanswerable .
idris stood beside me, her dear hand locked in mine .
he gave not only a brief denial to his mother 's schemes, but published his intention of using his influence to diminish the power of the aristocracy, to effect a greater equalization of wealth and privilege, and to introduce a perfect system of republican government into england .
once idris named me casually a frown, a convulsive gesture of anger, shook her mother, and, with voice trembling with hate, she said  ''i am of little worth in this world; the young are impatient to push the old off the scene; but, idris, if you do not wish to see your mother expire at your feet, never again name that person to me; all else i can bear; and now i am resigned to the destruction of my cherished hopes: but it is too much to require that i should love the instrument that providence gifted with murderous properties for my destruction . ''
her timidity was not artificial, but arose from that fear of not being properly appreciated, that slight estimation of the neglect of the world, which also characterized raymond .
i asked her where he should be buried .
 ''there is much truth in what you say, '' said i,  ''and yet no man ever acts upon this theory .
 ''every minute, '' continued m  . krempe with warmth,  ''every instant that you have wasted on those books is utterly and entirely lost.
his countenance was rough but intelligent his ample brow and quick grey eyes seemed to look out, over his own plans, and the opposition of his enemies .
i threw myself at his feet, and took his hand,  ''yes, speak, and we shall be happy; there will no longer be doubt, no dreadful uncertainty; trust me, my affection will soothe your sorrow; speak that word and all danger will be past, and we shall love each other as before, and for ever . ''
when i mingled with other families i distinctly discerned how peculiarly fortunate my lot was, and gratitude assisted the development of filial love .
you will not dispute with me?
 ''there needs no persuasion, '' said the blushing perdita,  ''except your own dear promises, and my ready heart, which whispers to me that they are true . ''
i remained, while the storm lasted, watching its progress with curiosity and delight .
this lady died, but her lessons were indelibly impressed on the mind of safie, who sickened at the prospect of again returning to asia and being immured within the walls of a harem, allowed only to occupy herself with infantile amusements, ill suited to the temper of her soul, now accustomed to grand ideas and a noble emulation for virtue .
his mother, apparently inattentive, at once understood what was meant, and seeing the hold we had upon her, yielded the point to us .
he pointed out the errors, and the alterations that he wished to be made; he offered the greek a pencil that he might correct the sketch on the spot; this was refused by his visitor, who said that he perfectly understood, and would work at it at home .
first, i must thank you, lionel, for having remained here at my request .
his wife assured us, that he had not observed any difference, except in the absence of the children from his study, and to her infinite surprise he complained of this unaccustomed quiet .
let us go the world is our country now, and we will choose for our residence its most fertile spot .
but in truth, neither the lonely meditations of the hermit, nor the tumultuous raptures of the reveller, are capable of satisfying man 's heart .
she was a singular being, and, like me, inherited much of the peculiar disposition of our father .
but it is unworthy of me to argue and complain .
tragedies deep and dire were the chief favourites .
raymond expressed himself delighted to see him, declaring that he should make one in the festivity of the night .
a restlessness, a fear of what was about to betide, a doubt as to raymond 's purposes, urged me to return without delay to his quarters .
it was this that led me here: i thought that if i could again awaken in my heart the grief i had felt at the loss of your mother, and the many associations with her memory which had been laid to sleep for seventeen years, that all love for her child would become extinct .
you are going to make enquiries concerning the earl of windsor .
chapter  ''i now hasten to the more moving part of my story .
do not then continue to fix your eyes on the earth; raise them on me for i can read your soul in them: speak to me to me sic, and pardon my presumption .
alas to me the idea of an immediate union with my elizabeth was one of horror and dismay .
never should he behold her fallen, as she deemed, from her pride of beauty, the poverty stricken inhabitant of a garret, with a name which had become a reproach, and a weight of guilt on her soul .
he was far too long sighted in his view of humanity to heed the casualties of the day, and lived in the midst of contagion unconscious of its existence .
raymond then lamented the cureless evil of his situation with perdita .
 ''are you mad, my friend? '' said he .  ''or whither does your senseless curiosity lead you?
he had promised to spend some hours with me one afternoon but a violent and continual rain prevented him .
a tear seemed to dim her eye when she saw us, but she quickly recovered herself, and a look of sorrowful affection seemed to attest her utter guiltlessness .
who ordered your attack?
in days of happiness i have often repeated to myself, with a grateful heart and exulting spirit, all that raymond sacrificed for me .
 ''you have guessed right; i have lately been so deeply engaged in one occupation that i have not allowed myself sufficient rest, as you see; but i hope, i sincerely hope, that all these employments are now at an end and that i am at length free . ''
you may believe that i did not enter on my present line of conduct without reluctance and pain .
 ''here, then, i retreated and lay down happy to have found a shelter, however miserable, from the inclemency of the season, and still more from the barbarity of man .
elizabeth saw even this last resource, her excellent dispositions and irreproachable conduct, about to fail the accused, when, although violently agitated, she desired permission to address the court .
come, give me your hand, one look of joyous sympathy and we will go together and seek them; a lulling journey; where our arrival will bring bliss and our waking be that of angels .
what appeared to us more astonishing, was that these writings were expressed in various languages: some unknown to my companion, ancient chaldee, and egyptian hieroglyphics, old as the pyramids .
i found adrian 's anti chamber crowded it was his hour for giving audience .
towards the end of october it dwindled away, and was in some degree replaced by a typhus, of hardly less virulence .
the shadows of things assumed strange and ghastly shapes .
at first it was the great object of my ambition to rival the merits of my father, and render myself worthy of the friendship of adrian .
my ancestors had been for many years counsellors and syndics, and my father had filled several public situations with honour and reputation .
i told them exceedingly few deaths had yet been occasioned by pestilence, and gave them hopes, as we were the last visited, so the calamity might have lost its most venomous power before it had reached us .
for this i had deprived myself of rest and health .
several days elapsed, and at last an answer came, dated from cologne .
the cold is excessive, and many of my unfortunate comrades have already found a grave amidst this scene of desolation .
it is your duty as a magistrate, and i believe and hope that your feelings as a man will not revolt from the execution of those functions on this occasion . ''
he foresaw that he should leave this cheerful earth, the lightsome sky, and thy love, perdita; yet he neither hesitated or turned back, going right onward to his mark of fame .
she thought her the model of all excellence and endeavoured to imitate her phraseology and manners, so that even now she often reminds me of her .
 ''it was morning when i awoke, and my first care was to visit the fire .
we approached with all the speed six rowers could give; the orderly and picturesque dress of the soldiers on the beach, the sounds of exulting music, the stirring breeze and waving flags, the unchecked exclamations of the eager crowd, whose dark looks and foreign garb were purely eastern; the sight of temple crowned rock, the white marble of the buildings glittering in the sun, and standing in bright relief against the dark ridge of lofty mountains beyond; the near roar of the sea, the splash of oars, and dash of spray, all steeped my soul in a delirium, unfelt, unimagined in the common course of common life .
who deserved the hand of this self exalted king more than she whose glance belonged to a queen of nations?
but a bitter thought swiftly shadowed her joy; she bent her eyes on the ground, endeavouring to master the passion of tears that threatened to overwhelm her .
i cannot guess how many days have passed since then, but i have endured misery which nothing but the eternal sentiment of a just retribution burning within my heart could have enabled me to support .
they planted the cannon on the tumuli, sole elevations in this level country, and formed themselves into column and hollow square; while the pioneers threw up small mounds for their protection .
one day, while i was gradually recovering, i was seated in a chair, my eyes half open and my cheeks livid like those in death .
she framed her enquiries with greek subtlety; she formed her conclusions with the decision and firmness peculiar to her disposition .
from within the city neither shout nor cry, nor aught except the casual howling of a dog, broke the noon day stillness .
by degrees, after the morning 's dawn, sleep came .
i put my hand before my eyes, and cried out in agony,   ''oh take him away i cannot see him; for god's sake, do not let him enter '' mr  . kirwin regarded me with a troubled countenance.
 ''exactly so, '' replied raymond,  ''another link of the breakless chain .
i have longed for a friend; i have sought one who would sympathize with and love me .
raymond adduced many arguments and fervent persuasions to overcome her feeling, but she remained unconvinced; and, agitated by the discussion, she wildly and passionately made a solemn vow, to fly and hide herself where he never could discover her, where famine would soon bring death to conclude her woes, if he persisted in his to her disgracing offers .
in those days how often did i hear of his attractions, his wide spread conquests, his wit, his refined manners .
was i, then, a monster, a blot upon the earth, from which all men fled and whom all men disowned?
the growing shadow rose and rose, filling, and then seeming to endeavour to burst beyond, the adamantine vault that bent over, sustaining and enclosing the world .
i cannot pretend to describe what i then felt .

he was now all love, all softness; and when i raised my eyes in wonder at him as he spoke the smile on his lips told me that his heart was possessed by the gentlest passions .
an ample estate was allotted to them, and they took the first rank among the peers of great britain .
i wished for no friend, no sympathy .
and when the development of her understanding disclosed the true nature of this intercourse to her, her affections were already engaged to her friend, and all she feared was lest other attractions and fickleness might make him break his infant vows .
he never sported, but spent hours in watching the tribes of lovely and almost tame animals with which it was stocked, and ordered that greater care should be taken of them than ever .
in the mean time raymond was eloquent .
with his permission my mother prevailed on her rustic guardians to yield their charge to her .
 ''and those who do not work for posterity; or working, as may be my case, will not be known by it; yet they, believe me, have also their duties .

i no longer despair, but look on all around me with placid affection .
have not actors wept, as they pourtrayed imagined passion?
but the haughty ex queen thought as octavius caesar and mark antony, we could not stall together in the whole world .
 ''during the ensuing days, while the preparations were going forward for the escape of the merchant, the zeal of felix was warmed by several letters that he received from this lovely girl, who found means to express her thoughts in the language of her lover by the aid of an old man, a servant of her father who understood french .
the late setting of the moon, and the extreme caution i was obliged to use in this my third expedition, consumed so much time, that something like a qualm of fear came over me when i perceived dark night yield to twilight .
when we arrived at kishan, we learnt, that on hearing of the advance of lord raymond and his detachment, the turkish army had retreated from rodosto; but meeting with a reinforcement, they had re trod their steps .
he could have endured poverty, and while this distress had been the meed of his virtue, he gloried in it; but the ingratitude of the turk and the loss of his beloved safie were misfortunes more bitter and irreparable .
i quitted my seat, and walked on, although the darkness and storm increased every minute, and the thunder burst with a terrific crash over my head .
lights now appeared to guide us; and a long suite of splendid rooms illuminated, made us still more wonder .
raymond 's eyes were fixed on the city .
i have described myself as always having been imbued with a fervent longing to penetrate the secrets of nature .
we were told this when young, and taught to look forward to it as an event that would certainly take place .
i tell you i am on the very verge of insanity; why, cruel girl, do you drive me on: you will repent and i shall die . ''
her mild eyes seemed incapable of any severity or guile, and yet she has committed a murder . ''
raymond was ten years older; to his previous beauty, noble mien, and commanding aspect, he now added gentlest benevolence, winning tenderness, graceful and unwearied attention to the wishes of another .
there were no horses to be procured, and i must return by the lake; but the wind was unfavourable, and the rain fell in torrents .
i was unable to remain for a single instant in the same place; i jumped over the chairs, clapped my hands, and laughed aloud .
she married; and, carrying her restless energy of character with her into new scenes, she turned her thoughts to ambition, and aimed at the title and power of princess of wallachia; while her patriotic feelings were soothed by the idea of the good she might do her country, when her husband should be chief of this principality .
better die at once better plunge a poinard in her bosom, still untouched by drear adversity, and then again sheathe it in my own but, no; in times of misery we must fight against our destinies, and strive not to be overcome by them .
do you not see my tears which i in vain strive against you hear unmoved my voice broken by sobs feel how my hand trembles: my whole heart is in the words i speak and you must not endeavour to silence me by mere words barren of meaning: the agony of my doubt hurries me on, and you must reply .
she tried to disperse them, but they refused to be checked her utterance was choaked .
with these, her children, the noble widow constantly resided at windsor; and admitted no visitors, except her own partizans, travellers from her native germany, and a few of the foreign ministers .
i had no fear, therefore, that any circumstantial evidence could be brought forward strong enough to convict her .
pestilence had become a part of our future, our existence; it was to be guarded against, like the flooding of rivers, the encroachments of ocean, or the inclemency of the sky .
it was the secrets of heaven and earth that i desired to learn; and whether it was the outward substance of things or the inner spirit of nature and the mysterious soul of man that occupied me, still my inquiries were directed to the metaphysical, or in its highest sense, the physical secrets of the world .
you must begin life, he said: you are seventeen, and longer delay would render the necessary apprenticeship more and more irksome .
but why approach my chamber?
i had money with me and gained the friendship of the villagers by distributing it; or i brought with me some food that i had killed, which, after taking a small part, i always presented to those who had provided me with fire and utensils for cooking .
shouts from a thousand voices now rent the air the cry of applause became universal .
we were told that this would not be the case; that we were by nature a poetical people, a nation easily duped by words, ready to array clouds in splendour, and bestow honour on the dust .
at length lassitude succeeded to the tumult i had before endured, and i threw myself on the bed in my clothes, endeavouring to seek a few moments of forgetfulness .
in a thousand ways he smoothed for me the path of knowledge and made the most abstruse inquiries clear and facile to my apprehension .
the leafless trees spread their fibrous branches against the pure sky; their intricate and pervious tracery resembled delicate sea weed; the deer were turning up the snow in search of the hidden grass; the white was made intensely dazzling by the sun, and trunks of the trees, rendered more conspicuous by the loss of preponderating foliage, gathered around like the labyrinthine columns of a vast temple; it was impossible not to receive pleasure from the sight of these things .
his first wish was aggrandisement; and the means that led towards this end were secondary considerations .
 ''how kind and generous you are every one else believes in her guilt, and that made me wretched, for i knew that it was impossible: and to see every one else prejudiced in so deadly a manner rendered me hopeless and despairing . ''
he appeared like the forgotten spirit of the time in the theatres, and bade the spectators go home and die .
 ''weep not, sweet child, '' said he,  ''the coming death of one you have hardly known .
by degrees, i remember, a stronger light pressed upon my nerves, so that i was obliged to shut my eyes .
i was punctual to the appointed hour on the following day, and found lord raymond waiting for me .
they retreated, and, joining others of their companions, still fell back, till they reached the main body .
adrian 's soul was painted in his countenance, and concealment or deceit were at the antipodes to the dreadless frankness of his nature .
my father had been and his memory was the life of my life .
do not return to your families with the stigma of disgrace marked on your brows .
the singing was interrupted by laughing and talking; never was merry ditty so sadly timed, never laughter more akin to tears .
adrian despised the narrow views of the politician, and raymond held in supreme contempt the benevolent visions of the philanthropist .
their incursion would hardly have been felt had they come alone; but the irish, collected in unnatural numbers, began to feel the inroads of famine, and they followed in the wake of the americans for england also .
at last he rose, and said in his usual tone of voice,  ''the time grows on us, verney, i must away .
sometimes we passed whole days under the leafy covert of the forest with our books and music .
it was impossible to effect any thing in so short a time .
my reply was ready; a reproach i deemed calculated to sting his very heart .
it is more cold within her, than a fire left by gypsies in winter time, the spent embers crowned by a pyramid of snow .
mont blanc, the supreme and magnificent mont blanc, raised itself from the surrounding aiguilles, and its tremendous dome overlooked the valley .
before i had quitted your apartment, on a sensation of cold, i had covered myself with some clothes, but these were insufficient to secure me from the dews of night .
yes, you are the sole, the agonizing cause of all i suffer, of all i must suffer untill i die .
but i was restrained, when i thought of the heroic and suffering elizabeth, whom i tenderly loved, and whose existence was bound up in mine .
she saw that he was endowed with genius and surpassing talent; these she cultivated for the sake of afterwards using them for the furtherance of her own views .
nor shall you, my friend; cheer up; cease to weep, i entreat you .
in this state of mind i wrote to elizabeth .
write, dearest victor, one line one word will be a blessing to us .
but you are distant from me, and it is possible that you may dread and yet be pleased with this explanation; and in a probability of this being the case, i dare not any longer postpone writing what, during your absence, i have often wished to express to you but have never had the courage to begin .
 ''after the murder of clerval i returned to switzerland, heart broken and overcome .
she welcomed me with the greatest affection .
i once had a friend, the most noble of human creatures, and am entitled, therefore, to judge respecting friendship .
at length the thought of you crossed my mind .
during the two years that had elapsed previous to their marriage my father had gradually relinquished all his public functions; and immediately after their union they sought the pleasant climate of italy, and the change of scene and interest attendant on a tour through that land of wonders, as a restorative for her weakened frame .
the flood and storms did more harm to continental europe than to us giving, as it were, the last blow to the calamities which destroyed it .
i have already put off the carelessness of childhood, the unlined brow, and springy gait of early years, that they may adorn thee .
this was to a great degree the case: for, though a large landed proprietor, yet, being a projector, and of an ardent and industrious disposition, he had on his own estate given himself up to agricultural labours .
i passed the night wretchedly .
nature grows old, and shakes in her decaying limbs, creation has become bankrupt what wonder then, that eclipse and death have led to destruction the light of thy life, o perdita '' chapter ix .
the hours were slow for each minute was employed; we lived more in one week than many do in the course of several months and the variety and novelty of our pleasures gave zest to each .
beaufort had taken effectual measures to conceal himself, and it was ten months before my father discovered his abode .
 ''i spent the winter in this manner .
i had acquired in my harp a companion in rainy days; a sweet soother of my feelings when any untoward accident ruffled them: i often addressed it as my only friend; i could pour forth to it my hopes and loves, and i fancied that its sweet accents answered me .
 ''one by one, her brothers and sister died; and her mother, with the exception of her neglected daughter, was left childless .
he loathed the idea that his daughter should be united to a christian, but he feared the resentment of felix if he should appear lukewarm, for he knew that he was still in the power of his deliverer if he should choose to betray him to the italian state which they inhabited .
one evening, quitting our inn, we strolled down a shady lane, then up a grassy slope, till we came to an eminence, that commanded an extensive view of hill and dale, meandering rivers, dark woods, and shining villages .
the silence of midnight, to speak truly, though apparently a paradox, rung in my ears .
will you accompany me to windsor to morrow?
we first came upon a few stragglers of the irish at st  . albans.
they hurried away, as soon as they saw me; my agitated mien added to their fear of coming near one who had entered within the verge of contagion .
the last action at which i was present was the taking of  .
they insisted, therefore, that i should engage with a solemn promise that if the vessel should be freed i would instantly direct my course southwards .
nothing could exceed in beauty the contrast between these two excellent creatures .
you throw a torch into a pile of buildings, and when they are consumed, you sit among the ruins and lament the fall .
we found raymond in his dining room with six others: the bottle was being pushed about merrily, and had made considerable inroads on the understanding of one or two .
one man in particular stood in front, his eyes fixt on the prophet, his mouth open, his limbs rigid, while his face changed to various colours, yellow, blue, and green, through intense fear .
the greek fleet blockading every port of stamboul, prevented the arrival of succour from asia; all egress on the side towards land had become impracticable, except to such desperate sallies, as reduced the numbers of the enemy without making any impression on our lines .
i repassed, in my memory, my whole life my quiet happiness while residing with my family in geneva, the death of my mother, and my departure for ingolstadt .
that idris, the princely born, nursling of wealth and luxury, should have come through the tempestuous winter night from her regal abode, and standing at my lowly door, conjure me to fly with her through darkness and storm was surely a dream again her plaintive tones, the sight of her loveliness assured me that it was no vision .
after some observations on the scenery and seats, raymond said:  ''philosophers have called man a microcosm of nature, and find a reflection in the internal mind for all this machinery visibly at work around us .
he loved her for her beauty and for her amiable disposition but he seemed to love her more for what he considered her superior wisdom .
his design was to visit india, in the belief that he had in his knowledge of its various languages, and in the views he had taken of its society, the means of materially assisting the progress of european colonization and trade .
they entered, and their leader addressed me .
the resources of his mind on this occasion were truly astonishing: his conversation was full of imagination; and very often, in imitation of the persian and arabic writers, he invented tales of wonderful fancy and passion .
the whole series of my life appeared to me as a dream; i sometimes doubted if indeed it were all true, for it never presented itself to my mind with the force of reality .
 ''get well and return to us .
what a brimful cup of joyful agony it was, when his face first gleamed with the glance of recognition when he pressed my hand, now more fevered than his own, and when he pronounced my name no trace of his past insanity remained, to dash my joy with sorrow .
what though those limbs moved not, and those lips could no more frame modulated accents of wisdom and love what though like a weed flung from the fruitless sea, he lay the prey of corruption still that was the form she had caressed, those the lips that meeting hers, had drank the spirit of love from the commingling breath; that was the earthly mechanism of dissoluble clay she had called her own .
the buds decked the trees, the flowers adorned the land: the dark branches, swollen with seasonable juices, expanded into leaves, and the variegated foliage of spring, bending and singing in the breeze, rejoiced in the genial warmth of the unclouded empyrean: the brooks flowed murmuring, the sea was waveless, and the promontories that over hung it were reflected in the placid waters; birds awoke in the woods, while abundant food for man and beast sprung up from the dark ground .
she weeps continually, and accuses herself unjustly as the cause of his death; her words pierce my heart .
these were dreadful fears and they even haunted my dreams .
idris is a gentle, pretty, sweet little girl; it is impossible not to have an affection for her, and i have a very sincere one; only do not speak of love love, the tyrant and the tyrant queller; love, until now my conqueror, now my slave; the hungry fire, the untameable beast, the fanged snake no no i will have nothing to do with that love .
 ''you propose, '' replied i,  ''to fly from the habitations of man, to dwell in those wilds where the beasts of the field will be your only companions .
but i, the true murderer, felt the never dying worm alive in my bosom, which allowed of no hope or consolation .
at first i had neglected them, but now that i was able to decipher the characters in which they were written, i began to study them with diligence .
be proud of me, and cherish your infant remembrance of me .
dreadful as the time was when i pursued my father towards the ocean, found their sic only his lifeless corpse; yet for my own sake i should prefer that to the watching one by one his senses fade; his pulse weaken and sleeplessly as it were devour his life in gazing .
henry wished to dissuade me, but seeing me bent on this plan, ceased to remonstrate .
i turned angrily away:  ''verney, '' said adrian,  ''you are very cynical: sit down; or if you will not, perhaps, as you are not a frequent visitor, lord raymond will humour you, and accompany us, as we had previously agreed upon, to parliament . ''
from him she sprung, flesh of his flesh, bone of his bone and not, as heretofore, are you content to trace in her downy cheek and delicate limbs, an affinity to raymond, but in her enthusiastic affections, in the sweet qualities of her mind, you may still find him living, the good, the great, the beloved .
his wit, his bon mots, the record of his personal attractions, fascinating manners, and social talents, were long remembered and repeated from mouth to mouth .
farewell, perdita farewell, poor girl never again will you see yourself thus; luxury and wealth are no longer yours; in the excess of your poverty you may envy the homeless beggar; most truly am i without a home i live on a barren desart, which, wide and interminable, brings forth neither fruit or flower; in the midst is a solitary rock, to which thou, perdita, art chained, and thou seest the dreary level stretch far away . ''
his tale is connected and told with an appearance of the simplest truth, yet i own to you that the letters of felix and safie, which he showed me, and the apparition of the monster seen from our ship, brought to me a greater conviction of the truth of his narrative than his asseverations, however earnest and connected .
his plans were facilitated by the news which arrived from paris .
agatha, the ever gentle agatha, kissed the hands of the lovely stranger, and pointing to her brother, made signs which appeared to me to mean that he had been sorrowful until she came .
at length it was mentioned in the newspapers .
woodville was obliged to make a journey into the country and was detained from day to day in irksome absence from his lovely bride .
some miracle might have produced it, yet the stages of the discovery were distinct and probable .
could he be i shuddered at the conception the murderer of my brother?
will no entreaties cause thee to turn a favourable eye upon thy creature, who implores thy goodness and compassion?
the same half disdainful lips and smile of triumph, the same intelligent eyes, the same brow and chestnut hair; her very hands and taper fingers resembled his .
as he was proceeding along the sands, he struck his foot against something and fell at his length on the ground .
the very beauty of the grecian climate, during the season of spring, added torture to her sensations .
and then he devoutly loved perdita; the bend of her head, her glossy ringlets, the turn of her form were to him subjects of deep tenderness and admiration; as she spoke, her melodious tones entered his soul; he soon softened towards her, comforting and caressing her, and endeavouring to cheat himself into the belief that he had never wronged her .
but soon the dim orb passed from over the sun, and lingered down the eastern heaven .
 ''do not degrade me in my own eyes, '' she said;  ''poverty has long been my nurse; hard visaged she is, but honest .
the events that immediately followed on my arrival at windsor changed this view of things .
on earth i thought that i had well fulfilled my trial my last moments became peaceful with the reflection that i deserved no blame but you take from me that feeling my passions were there my all to me and the hopeless misery that possessed me shut all love all images of beauty from my soul nature was to me as the blackest night if rays of loveliness ever strayed into my darkness it was only to draw bitter tears of hopeless anguish from my eyes oh on earth what consolation is there to misery?
looking timidly around, as if she feared to be overheard, she whispered:   ''i have discovered to morrow that is, to day already the to morrow is come before dawn, foreigners, austrians, my mother's hirelings, are to carry me off to germany, to prison, to marriage to anything, except you and my brother take me away, or soon they will be here '' i was frightened by her vehemence, and imagined some mistake in her incoherent tale; but i no longer hesitated to obey her .
i was often tempted, when all was at peace around me, and i the only unquiet thing that wandered restless in a scene so beautiful and heavenly if i except some bat, or the frogs, whose harsh and interrupted croaking was heard only when i approached the shore often, i say, i was tempted to plunge into the silent lake, that the waters might close over me and my calamities forever .
the following morning lord raymond visited me early .
will you accompany me?
my departure for ingolstadt, which had been deferred by these events, was now again determined upon .
i was a poor, helpless, miserable wretch; i knew, and could distinguish, nothing; but feeling pain invade me on all sides, i sat down and wept .
you are grieved and there is grief in the expression of your countenance but it is gentle and sweet .
in crowded cities, among cultivated plains, or on the desart mountains, pain is thickly sown, and if we can tear up but one of these noxious weeds, or more, if in its stead we can sow one seed of corn, or plant one fair flower, let that be motive sufficient against suicide .
they were grass grown and desert .
besides, some months have elapsed since the commission of his crimes, and no one can conjecture to what place he has wandered or what region he may now inhabit . ''
your own delicacy will not allow you, i am convinced, to attempt to trace me .
i wandered for ever about these lovely solitudes, gathering flower after flower ond ' era pinta tutta la mia viab singing as i might the wild melodies of the country, or occupied by pleasant day dreams .
but if his countenance was more sorrowful, his voice was more cheerful than that of his sister, especially when he addressed the old man .
she grew capricious; her gentle conduct towards him was exchanged for asperity and repulsive coldness .
life was then brilliant; i began to learn to hope and what brings a more bitter despair to the heart than hope destroyed?
the stars came out, shedding their ineffectual glimmerings on the light widowed earth .
good night, my sister .
but revenge kept me alive; i dared not die and leave my adversary in being .
night closed in, and it began to rain .
i often thought that i would instantly return and take you along with me to some fertile island where we should live at peace for ever .
it was only when he was absent from me that his passion subdued him, that he clinched his hands knit his brows and with haggard looks called for death to his despair, raving wildly, untill exhausted he sank down nor was revived untill i joined him .
she uttered some words in a loud voice, and the youth joined her, who also expressed surprise .
perceiving the weakness of raymond, i was afraid of ill consequences from the pressure of the crowd on his landing .
 ''i do not know, '' said the man,  ''what the custom of the english may be, but it is the custom of the irish to hate villains . ''
some were royalists from prejudice and ancient affection, and there were many moderately inclined who feared alike the capricious tyranny of the popular party, and the unbending despotism of the aristocrats .
men made perilous journies to possess themselves of earth 's splendid trifles, gems and gold .
had i right, for my own benefit, to inflict this curse upon everlasting generations?
for a few moments i gazed with delight on her dark eyes, fringed by deep lashes, and her lovely lips; but presently my rage returned; i remembered that i was forever deprived of the delights that such beautiful creatures could bestow and that she whose resemblance i contemplated would, in regarding me, have changed that air of divine benignity to one expressive of disgust and affright .
i cannot describe the rapturous delight with which i turned from political brawls at home, and the physical evils of distant countries, to my own dear home, to the selected abode of goodness and love; to peace, and the interchange of every sacred sympathy .
his passage to power had been full of pain to both .
 ''merrival, '' i said,  ''it is long since we have seen you you must return to windsor with me lady idris desires to see you, you will not refuse her request come home with me . ''
in his amendment he proposed, that an exception should be made in the bill in favour of any person who claimed the sovereign power in right of the earls of windsor .
one by one these symptoms struck me; i became convinced that the moment i had so much desired was about to arrive and that i was dying .
we took leave of them in the protectoral palace .
i saw lord raymond on his charger; a small company of officers had gathered about him; and behind was a promiscuous concourse of soldiers and subalterns, their discipline lost, their arms thrown aside; no music sounded, no banners streamed .
all the ex queen 's friends were his friends; no week passed that he did not hold consultations with her at windsor .
we come, '' he exclaimed, springing forwards,  ''for what should we wait?
i pressed it to my lips, while the rough soldiers gathered around, mourning over this worthiest prey of death, as if regret and endless lamentation could re illumine the extinguished spark, or call to its shattered prison house of flesh the liberated spirit .
 ''alas my father, '' said i,  ''how little do you know me .
we visited the so called elysian fields and avernus: and wandered through various ruined temples, baths, and classic spots; at length we entered the gloomy cavern of the cumaean sibyl .
at first indeed this wanton spirit played a false part appearing with sable wings gloomy countenance seemed to take a pleasure in exagerating all my miseries and as small hopes arose to snatch them from me give me in their place gigantic fears which under her fairy hand appeared close, impending unavoidable sometimes she would cruelly leave me while i was thus on the verge of madness and without consoling me leave me nought but heavy leaden sleep but at other times she would wilily link less unpleasing thoughts to these most dreadful ones before i was aware place hopes before me futile but consoling one day this lovely spirit whose name as she told me was fantasia came to me in one of her consolotary moods her wings which seemed coloured by her tone of mind were not gay but beautiful like that of the partridge her lovely eyes although they ever burned with an unquenshable fire were shaded softened by her heavy lids the black long fringe of her eye lashes she thus addressed me you mourn for the loss of those you love .
he easily eluded me and said,  ''be calm i entreat you to hear me before you give vent to your hatred on my devoted head .
i learned also the names of the cottagers themselves .
she had lived for some years in an alms house, and on fine sundays her threshold was constantly beset by a crowd, seeking her advice and listening to her admonitions .
i had the newspaper in my hand, and, as usual, had turned to the intelligence from greece .
raymond looked keenly at him; he could read benignity only in his gentle lineaments; he turned to me, observing with scorn my moody and stern demeanour .
if you can never be happy, can you never bestow happiness?
certainly the ryland that advanced towards us now, bore small resemblance to the powerful, ironical, seemingly fearless canvasser for the first rank among englishmen .
at all events methought that the wound could be healed; and, if they remained together, it would be so .
when she perceived the wild or pathetic appeal of his expressive countenance, she would relent, and for a while resume her ancient kindness .
but now my mother, or, if you will, my mother 's lessons, awaken within me .
yet it was less painful to see him thus, than to find him fulfilling the animal functions uninterruptedly, his mind sick the while .
he was a boy of singular talent and fancy .
and was i really as mad as the whole world would believe me to be if i disclosed the object of my suspicions?
i replied in the same language, with a feeble voice,  ''i believe i am; but if it be all true, if indeed i did not dream, i am sorry that i am still alive to feel this misery and horror . ''
but soon i endeavoured to extract patience for her from the ideas she suggested .
a letter came unawares, perdita read it .
 ''this account rather alarmed us, and we continued to search for him until night fell, when elizabeth conjectured that he might have returned to the house .
i was indifferent, therefore, to my school fellows in general; but i united myself in the bonds of the closest friendship to one among them .
i have been miserably mistaken in imagining that i could conquer my love for you; i never can .
when happy, inanimate nature had the power of bestowing on me the most delightful sensations .
ryland had shewn that he preferred him .
as it was, the sweet girl 's generous nature was roused to defend, and ally herself with, my despised cause .
farewell i must now leave you for a few hours .
i replied in a calm voice but how far from calm was the thought imaged by my still words  ''never i can never consent that lady idris should be united to one who does not love her  . ''  ''because you love her yourself. ''
ah, dear sister, how can i answer this question?
thus this towering spirit who had excited interest and high expectation in all who knew and could value him became at once, as it were, extinct .
the orphan and neglected son of verney, was on the eve of being linked to the mechanism of society by a golden chain, and to enter into all the duties and affections of life .
the foreigners whom we had among us, who had fled from the plague in their own country, now saw their last asylum invaded; and, fear making them garrulous, they described to eager listeners the miseries they had beheld in cities visited by the calamity, and gave fearful accounts of the insidious and irremediable nature of the disease .
elizabeth 's heart rending eloquence failed to move the judges from their settled conviction in the criminality of the saintly sufferer .
the poor animal recognised me, licked my hand, crept close to its lord, and died .
he loved her with passion and her tenderness had a charm for him that would not permit him to think of aught but her .
if you really say this, my questions are answered and all my doubts satisfied .
we cannot calculate on his forces like that of an engine; and, though an impulse draw with a forty horse power at what appears willing to yield to one, yet in contempt of calculation the movement is not effected .
her voice was suffocated with sobs .
on being charged with the fact, the poor girl confirmed the suspicion in a great measure by her extreme confusion of manner .
chapter clerval then put the following letter into my hands .
yet could i, in justice, or even in possibility, refuse this demand?
the possession of these treasures gave me extreme delight; i now continually studied and exercised my mind upon these histories, whilst my friends were employed in their ordinary occupations .
all that had so long engaged my attention suddenly grew despicable .
a murmur of surprise and horror ran through the assembly .
and do i dare to ask of you to undertake my pilgrimage, to endure the hardships that i have undergone?
you were hereafter to be hailed as the benefactors of your species, your names adored as belonging to brave men who encountered death for honour and the benefit of mankind .
she thought he did well to assert his own will, but she wished that will to have been more intelligible to the multitude .
i must go, lionel the gods will it; and i must .
i was silent: all was silent except the roaring of the sea which became louder and more dreadful .
he showed unparalleled malignity and selfishness in evil; he destroyed my friends; he devoted to destruction beings who possessed exquisite sensations, happiness, and wisdom; nor do i know where this thirst for vengeance may end .
i inquired the way to the inn, but no one replied .
i well knew that if any other had communicated such a relation to me, i should have looked upon it as the ravings of insanity .
he was a turkish merchant and had inhabited paris for many years, when, for some reason which i could not learn, he became obnoxious to the government .
for many days i have longed to disclose the mysterious presentiments that weigh on me, although i fear that you will ridicule them .
the grand jury rejected the bill, on its being proved that i was on the orkney islands at the hour the body of my friend was found; and a fortnight after my removal i was liberated from prison .
during three months i have been employed in this task .
from the moment perdita had sufficiently recovered herself to form any plan of action, she had laid one down, which now she prepared to follow .
this old woman had reached her hundredth year; her skin was shrivelled, her form was bent and lost in extreme decrepitude; but as still from year to year she continued in existence, out living many younger and stronger, she began to feel as if she were to live for ever .
the persian, arabic, and sanskrit languages engaged his attention, and i was easily induced to enter on the same studies .
here i may even cease to repine, and may add my tardy consent to the decree which has taken him from me .
guileless himself, adrian feared no deceit .
thus, while raymond had been wrapt in visions of power and fame, while he looked forward to entire dominion over the elements and the mind of man, the territory of his own heart escaped his notice; and from that unthought of source arose the mighty torrent that overwhelmed his will, and carried to the oblivious sea, fame, hope, and happiness .
he is irrecoverably mad . ''
was there indeed anarchy in the sublime universe of adrian 's thoughts, did madness scatter the well appointed legions, and was he no longer the lord of his own soul?
she leads them to truth wisdom untill the time comes when they shall be fitted for the journey through the universe which all must one day undertake farewell and now, gentlest reader i must beg your indulgence i am a being too weak to record the words of diotima her matchless wisdom heavenly eloquence .
sordid care, avaunt menial labours, and pains, slight in themselves, but too gigantic for our exhausted strength, shall make no part of our ephemeral existences .
the villages were decorated by triumphal arches of greenery by day, and lamps by night; tapestry waved from the windows, the ground was strewed with flowers, and the name of raymond, joined to that of greece, was echoed in the evive of the peasant crowd .
early in the day, argyropylo was wounded dangerously, and raymond assumed the command of the whole army .
how delicious to me were the words of his letter that concerned me:  ''i cannot tell you, '' it said,  ''how ardently i desire to see my mathilda .
shall i go alone, or will you accompany me? ''
until now, my savage habits had done me no radical mischief; my physical powers had grown up and flourished under their influence, and my mind, undergoing the same discipline, was imbued with all the hardy virtues .
the anniversary was at hand of the exaltation of raymond to the office of protector; and it was customary to celebrate this day by a splendid festival .
as i spoke, a dark gloom spread over my listener 's countenance .
he had been struck by the fortitude and beauty of the ill fated greek; and, when her constant tenderness towards him unfolded itself, he asked with astonishment, by what act of his he had merited this passionate and unrequited love .
she did not in the least resemble either of her children; her black and sparkling eye, lit up by pride, was totally unlike the blue lustre, and frank, benignant expression of either adrian or idris .
again i am a solitary man; and i will become again, as in my early years, a wanderer, a soldier of fortune .
i was as a solitary spot among mountains shut in on all sides by steep black precipices; where no ray of heat could penetrate; and from which there was no outlet to sunnier fields .
all i now ask, all your mother, idris, requests is, that you will not see this upstart during the interval of one month . ''
i was bewildered, in a cloud of wonder and horror .
i resolved at length to accompany perdita .
woe befall the day, she thought, woe, tears, and mourning betide the hour, that gave raymond another hope than love, another wish than my devotion; and thrice joyful the moment when he shall be restored to me god knows, i put my trust in his vows, and believe his asserted faith but for that, i would not seek what i am now resolved to attain .
he grasped my hand affectionately:  ''thank you, '' he said,  ''you have relieved me from a painful dilemma, and are, as you ever were, the best of my friends .
 ''but it is true that i am a wretch .
hear him not; call on the names of william, justine, clerval, elizabeth, my father, and of the wretched victor, and thrust your sword into his heart .
but your sad mien never alters; your pulses beat and you breathe, yet you seem already to belong to another world; and sometimes, pray pardon my wild thoughts, when you touch my hand i am surprised to find your hand warm when all the fire of life seems extinct within you .
he discovered the name of the spot whither my father had retreated, and where he died; he learnt the existence of his orphan children; and during the short interval between his arrival at ulswater and our meeting in the park, he had been occupied in making inquiries concerning us, and arranging a variety of plans for our benefit, preliminary to his introducing himself to our notice .
he was found stiff, his hands clenched, and pressed against his breast .
no; i am not so selfish .
still i think, that time, and even absence, may restore her to me .
it was situated against the back of the cottage and surrounded on the sides which were exposed by a pig sty and a clear pool of water .
the autumn was warm and rainy: the infirm and sickly died off happier they: many young people flushed with health and prosperity, made pale by wasting malady, became the inhabitants of the grave .
he was one of those very few whom fortune favours from their birth; on whom she bestows all gifts of intellect and person with a profusion that knew no bounds, and whom under her peculiar protection, no imperfection however slight, or disappointment however transitory has leave to touch .
often, when wearied by a toilsome march, i persuaded myself that i was dreaming until night should come and that i should then enjoy reality in the arms of my dearest friends .
my duties towards the beings of my own species had greater claims to my attention because they included a greater proportion of happiness or misery .
 ''yes, '' said elizabeth,  ''i will go, although she is guilty; and you, victor, shall accompany me; i cannot go alone . ''
but i forget that i am moralizing in the most interesting part of my tale, and your looks remind me to proceed .
i have no one near me, gentle yet courageous, possessed of a cultivated as well as of a capacious mind, whose tastes are like my own, to approve or amend my plans .
not so raymond; he was an enchanter, whose reign was for ever undiminished; a king whose power never was suspended: follow him through the details of common life, still the same charm of grace and majesty adorned him; nor could he be despoiled of the innate deification with which nature had invested him .
when we were together i spoke little yet my selfish mind was sometimes borne away by the rapid course of his ideas; i would lift my eyes with momentary brilliancy until memories that never died and seldom slept would recur, and a tear would dim them .
i motioned him to take up the letter, while i walked up and down the room in the extremest agitation .
death and disease level all men .
she had no experience beyond her father 's cottage; and the mansion of the lord of the manor was the chiefest type of grandeur she could conceive .
a new species would bless me as its creator and source; many happy and excellent natures would owe their being to me .
we had prepared a banquet for our guests in the lower hall of the castle; and thither idris and i repaired to receive and entertain the few that remained .
i could hardly sustain the multitude of feelings that crowded into my mind .
 ''entertain this belief, '' he cried,  ''hug it to your heart make it a pillow to your head, an opiate for your eyes i am content .
many living deaths have i borne for thee, o raymond, and now i expire, thy victim by my death i purchase thee lo the instruments of war, fire, the plague are my servitors .
such incursions struck the english with affright, in all those towns where there was still sufficient population to feel the change .
the high walls of the tomb, and the flaming sword of plague, lie between it and him .
the field of ice is almost a league in width, but i spent nearly two hours in crossing it .
why my sic does my heart heave with vain endeavour to cast aside the bitter anguish that covers it  ''as the waters cover the sea . ''
alas it was double cruelty in him to have chosen the sea for his fatal resolve; it was adding madness to my despair .
the name of the king, he to whom my dying father had addressed his latest prayers, and who had barbarously slighted them, was associated only with the ideas of unkindness, injustice, and consequent resentment .
yet let me a little retract from this sentence i have passed on myself .
i see by your eagerness and the wonder and hope which your eyes express, my friend, that you expect to be informed of the secret with which i am acquainted; that cannot be; listen patiently until the end of my story, and you will easily perceive why i am reserved upon that subject .
were the pride of ancestry, the patrician spirit, the gentle courtesies and refined pursuits, splendid attributes of rank, to be erased among us?
social feeling and sympathy constituted a marked feature in my disposition .
as he spoke, every sound was hushed, every thought suspended by intense attention .
i started up, my strength returned; sic with my terror; i cried,  ''oh, god is this thy decree?
burke has said that,   'in all bodies those who would lead, must also, in a considerable degree, follow .'
i never loved any but you .
pardon me, gentle reader, this is not futile vanity; not futile, since to know that adrian felt thus, brings joy even now to my lone heart .
she directed everything to be prepared for the continuance of their journey, and placing her lovely sleeping charge on a bed, passed several hours in acute suffering .
i feel yet parched with horror, nor can i reflect on that terrible moment without shuddering and agony .
this good woman had stood in the place of a mother, and her very deficiencies of education and knowledge, by rendering her humble and defenceless, endeared her to us she was the especial favourite of the children .
we conjectured, notwithstanding what we had heard, that we should find raymond in st  . stephen 's: thither we sped.
he felt assured, after he had for awhile humoured her self will, that in the end friendship and reason would gain the day .
i know not by what chain of thought the idea presented itself, but it instantly darted into my mind that the murderer had come to mock at my misery and taunt me with the death of clerval, as a new incitement for me to comply with his hellish desires .
i tell you we are no longer miserable mortals; we are about to become gods; spirits free and happy as gods .
the world was to me a secret which i desired to divine .
the plain around was interspersed with cemeteries, turk, greek, and armenian, with their growth of cypress trees; and other woods of more cheerful aspect, diversified the scene .
 ''all men hate the wretched; how, then, must i be hated, who am miserable beyond all living things yet you, my creator, detest and spurn me, thy creature, to whom thou art bound by ties only dissoluble by the annihilation of one of us .
she had grown thin and pale; and her eyes often filled with tears .
if, instead of this remark, my father had taken the pains to explain to me that the principles of agrippa had been entirely exploded and that a modern system of science had been introduced which possessed much greater powers than the ancient, because the powers of the latter were chimerical, while those of the former were real and practical, under such circumstances i should certainly have thrown agrippa aside and have contented my imagination, warmed as it was, by returning with greater ardour to my former studies .
turning to him, therefore, i said,  ''i consent to your demand, on your solemn oath to quit europe forever, and every other place in the neighbourhood of man, as soon as i shall deliver into your hands a female who will accompany you in your exile . ''
her only consolation during the violence which she did herself, was to watch the motions of an illuminated clock, and internally count the moments which must elapse before she could be alone .
the sight of the military restored hope to those who fled, and revenge took place of fear .
then i should have lived upon this dreary heath unvisited, and blasting none by my unhallowed gaze .
 ''in his murder my crimes are consummated; the miserable series of my being is wound to its close oh, frankenstein generous and self devoted being what does it avail that i now ask thee to pardon me?
he mentioned the beauties of his native country and asked us if those were not sufficient allurements to induce us to prolong our journey as far north as perth, where he resided .
at least it would be a benevolent action to rescue the sufferer, whether human or brute, from the desolation of the town; so, sending clara back to her home, i again entered constantinople .
perdita rejoined him, and before her he forced himself to appear cheerful, for she, even as a mirror, changed as he changed, and if he were silent and anxious, she solicitously inquired concerning, and endeavoured to remove the cause of his seriousness .
near the fire was ryland and his supporters .
day after day so many hundreds wore on; they brought no outward changes with them, but some few slowly operated on my mind as i glided on towards death .
she regarded with suspicion the invitation of idris; she embraced me, as if she were about to be deprived of my affection also: calling me her more than brother, her only friend, her last hope, she pathetically conjured me not to cease to love her; and with encreased anxiety she departed for london, the scene and cause of all her misery .
you who have dedicated your powers of mind and fortune to the benefit of your species, shall you so misdirect your exertions, as to support in uselessness the strong, healthy, and capable? ''
at last, with slow and heavy steps, i had paced out of the hall, and sprung upon my horse .
i clung to my ferocious habits, yet half despised them; i continued my war against civilization, and yet entertained a wish to belong to it .
but my father; my beloved and most wretched father?
no human being could have passed a happier childhood than myself .
 ''she will of course, as i shall her, when we are married . ''
you, perhaps, regard her as your sister, without any wish that she might become your wife .
we may not part until you have promised to comply with my requisition .
turning her thoughts this way, i gave them an object which rescued them from insanity .
she had never been married; and for the last five years had lived perfectly alone on an estate, that had descended to her through her mother, on the shores of loch lomond in scotland .
when i came to the reality, and saw regiments file off to the left far out of sight, fields intervening between the battalions, but a few troops sufficiently near me to observe their motions, i gave up all idea of understanding, even of seeing a battle, but attaching myself to raymond attended with intense interest to his actions .
there she would behold the tomb of her parents, and the territory filled with recollections of her father 's glory .
the ward was filled with an effluvia that caused my heart to heave with painful qualms .
once for a moment she revived and recognized his voice; a smile, a last lovely smile, played upon her lips .
with shuddering horror i veiled this monument of human passion and human misery; i heaped over her all of flags and heavy accoutrements i could find, to guard her from birds and beasts of prey, until i could bestow on her a fitting grave .
i felt a holy rapture spring from all i saw .
with her therefore, before me on my horse, attended only by the servant who was to re conduct her, we rode to the top kapou .
we will set up a candidate, and ensure his success .
whither does this lead?
the young man and his companion often went apart and appeared to weep .
he felt that the end of time was come; he knew that one by one we should dwindle into nothingness .
see you not the thunderbolt fall, and are deafened by the shout of heaven that follows its descent?
i rushed towards her and embraced her with ardour, but the deadly languor and coldness of the limbs told me that what i now held in my arms had ceased to be the elizabeth whom i had loved and cherished .
it is a part of man 's nature to adapt itself through habit even to pain and sorrow .
 ''how inconstant are your feelings but a moment ago you were moved by my representations, and why do you again harden yourself to my complaints?
i watched the re awakened devotion of my sister; clara  's timid, but concentrated admiration of her father, and raymond's appetite for renown, and sensitiveness to the demonstrations of affection of the athenians .
it was late in the day before perdita awoke, and a longer time elapsed before recovering from the torpor occasioned by the laudanum, she perceived her change of situation .
never for one moment when most placid did i cease to pray for death .
the girl was young and of gentle demeanour, unlike what i have since found cottagers and farmhouse servants to be .
much as they were attached to each other, they seemed to draw inexhaustible stores of affection from a very mine of love to bestow them upon me .
he received a letter from her to say that she was slightly ill, but telling him to hasten to her, that from his eyes she would receive health and that his company would be her surest medecine .
i shunned the face of man; all sound of joy or complacency was torture to me; solitude was my only consolation deep, dark, deathlike solitude .
i struggled vainly for firmness sufficient to answer him, but the effort destroyed all my remaining strength; i sank on the chair and sobbed aloud .
when she entered the court she threw her eyes round it and quickly discovered where we were seated .
the monster continued to utter wild and incoherent self reproaches .
its forest should be our world its garden afford us food; within its walls i would establish the shaken throne of health .
          'pardon this intrusion,' said i; 'i am a traveller in want of a little rest; you would greatly oblige me if you would allow me to remain a few minutes before the fire    .'  '''enter,' said de lacey, 'and i will try in what manner i can to relieve your wants; but, unfortunately, my children are from home, and as i am blind, i am afraid i shall find it difficult to procure food for you.'  '''do not trouble yourself, my kind host; i have food; it is warmth and rest only that i need.'  ''i sat down, and a silence ensued.
he transacted the business of the day apart from her; he went out, she knew not whither .
during the first stage of the election, the duke of had been thrown out; the question therefore lay between lord raymond and mr  . ryland.
that raymond should marry idris was more than ever intolerable; yet my passion, though a giant from its birth, was too strange, wild, and impracticable, for me to feel at once the misery i perceived in perdita .
again her chill limbs touched me as a torpedo; and i shuddered in sympathy with her pain and fright .
you have often agreed with me that there is but one solution to the intricate riddle of life; to improve ourselves, and contribute to the happiness of others: and now, in the very prime of life, you desert your principles, and shut yourself up in useless solitude .
raymond had fought and conquered for the athenians; he had suffered, on their account, peril, imprisonment, and hardship; their gratitude affected him deeply, and he inly vowed to unite his fate for ever to that of a people so enthusiastically devoted to him .
even now if we had courage we might be free .
this spirit existed as a breath, a wish, a far off thought, until communicated to adrian, who imbibed it with ardour, and instantly engaged himself in plans for its execution .
i gave to each heroine of whom i read, her beauty and matchless excellences such was antigone, when she guided the blind oedipus to the grove of the eumenides, and discharged the funeral rites of polynices; such was miranda in the unvisited cave of prospero; such haidee, on the sands of the ionian island .
i then moved forward, and a murmuring sound arose from the crowd as they followed and surrounded me, when an ill looking man approaching tapped me on the shoulder and said,   ''come, sir, you must follow me to mr  . kirwin's to give an account of yourself. ''
the few jewels they had saved, supported them awhile .
then on his word and will depended my own happiness the fate of all dear to me .
again her name was syllabled, and she shuddered as she asked herself, am i becoming mad, or am i dying, that i hear the voices of the departed?
the sight of her, in her present situation, passed like an arrow into his soul .
this expectation will now be the consolation of your father .
 ''do you not know, my friends, '' i said,  ''that the earl himself, now lord protector, visits daily, not only those probably infected by this disease, but the hospitals and pest houses, going near, and even touching the sick?
she seemed to be full of something to which she could not give words; but, seizing an opportunity afforded by perdita 's absence, she preferred to me an earnest prayer, that i would take her within view of the gate at which her father had entered constantinople .
can i see george? ''  ''see him, '' cried the woman,  ''yes, if you go to him; last night he was taken with the plague, and we sent him to the hospital . ''
in solitude, and through many wanderings afar from the haunts of men, he matured his views for the reform of the english government, and the improvement of the people .
if we went to italy, to sacred and eternal rome, we might with greater patience submit to the decree, which had laid her mighty towers low .
i met troops of horses, herds of cattle, flocks of sheep, wandering at will; here throwing down a hay rick, and nestling from cold in its heart, which afforded them shelter and food there having taken possession of a vacant cottage .
but that cannot be; the human senses are insurmountable barriers to our union .
the mountains of switzerland are more majestic and strange, but there is a charm in the banks of this divine river that i never before saw equalled .
persecuted and tortured as i am and have been, can death be any evil to me? ''  ''nothing indeed could be more unfortunate and agonizing than the strange chances that have lately occurred .
i have devoted my creator, the select specimen of all that is worthy of love and admiration among men, to misery; i have pursued him even to that irremediable ruin .
the nature of perdita was less perfect; but tenderness and happiness improved her temper, and softened her natural reserve .
i tried to soothe her; i bade her hope; i asked what tremendous consequences would ensue even on our failure .
the mind of raymond was not so rough cast, nor had been so rudely handled, in the circumstance of life, as to make him proof to these considerations on the contrary, he was all nerve; his spirit was as a pure fire, which fades and shrinks from every contagion of foul atmosphere: but now the contagion had become incorporated with its essence, and the change was the more painful .
but pardon me, i entreat you and listen to me: do not turn away from me; do not be impatient; you may easily intimidate me into silence, but my heart is bursting, nor can i willingly consent to endure for one moment longer the agony of uncertitude which for the last four months has been my portion .
clara often accompanied him in these excursions; partly that she might see her parents, partly because adrian delighted in the prattle, and intelligent looks of this lovely child .
the porter opened the gates of the court, which had that night been my asylum, and i issued into the streets, pacing them with quick steps, as if i sought to avoid the wretch whom i feared every turning of the street would present to my view .
my mother  's tender caresses and my father's smile of benevolent pleasure while regarding me are my first recollections .
i sought the hills; a west wind swept them, and the stars glittered above .
but no care could re animate her, no medicine cause her dear eyes to open, and the blood to flow again from her pulseless heart .
alas ye were the last of happiness that i ever enjoyed; a few, a very few weeks and all was destroyed .
windsor is not my home; my true home i have found; the home that the creator has prepared for me . ''
do your duty towards me, and i will do mine towards you and the rest of mankind .
london, which had extended so far in suburbs in all direction, had been somewhat deserted in the midst, and much of what had in former days obscured this vast building was removed .
even as she spoke i drew near to her, as if in terror, lest at that very moment the destroyer had been near to rob me of her .
even broken in spirit as he is, no one can feel more deeply than he does the beauties of nature .
i shall not pause in my exertions until that time; but, if plague revives with the coming year, all contest with her must cease, and our only occupation be the choice of a grave . ''
we are said to love much those whom we greatly benefit .
erringly and strangely she began the task of self examination with self condemnation .
on her deathbed the fortitude and benignity of this best of women did not desert her .
she longed to bid me hasten my return; a thousand conflicting emotions rendered her mute as she bade me a tearful, silent farewell .
now, at this evening hour, at the period of repose and refection, methinks all hearts breathe one hymn of love and thanksgiving, and we, like priests of old on the mountain tops, give a voice to their sentiment .
it had been displayed early in life, leading her out to solitary musing among her native mountains, causing her to form innumerous combinations from common objects, giving strength to her perceptions, and swiftness to their arrangement .
i have detailed the perfections of my sister; and yet she was utterly unlike idris .
her passions had subdued her appetites, even her natural wants; she slept little, and hardly ate at all; her body was evidently considered by her as a mere machine, whose health was necessary for the accomplishment of her schemes, but whose senses formed no part of her enjoyment .
what are your plans, my lord protector, for the benefit of our country? ''
are you a coward, woodville?
i do not say that if his own desires had been put in competition with those of others that he would have displayed undue selfishness, but this trial was never made .
soon our poor nurse expired; and the anguish of suspense was changed to deep regret, which though at first more painful, yet yielded with greater readiness to my consolations .
 ''if she is, god forbid that she should suffer as guilty .
a man would make but a very sorry chemist if he attended to that department of human knowledge alone .
 ''food, however, became scarce, and i often spent the whole day searching in vain for a few acorns to assuage the pangs of hunger .
before, she had been visited by pangs of fear now, she never enjoyed an interval of hope .
encourage the people by your presence .
once a writing of his fell into perdita 's hands; it was blotted with tears well might any blot it with the like  ''life '' it began thus  ''is not the thing romance writers describe it; going through the measures of a dance, and after various evolutions arriving at a conclusion, when the dancers may sit down and repose .
she seated herself then on the same ottoman where i had left her in the morning resting on the beating heart of her raymond; i dared not approach her, but sat at a distant corner, watching her starting and nervous gestures .
we had entered the castle .
i earned that; i deserved it .
he held out his hand with almost a bashful air .
i then went to idris, contriving in my way, plausible excuses for remaining all day in the castle, and endeavouring to disperse the traces of care from my brow .
but through the whole period during which i was the slave of my creature i allowed myself to be governed by the impulses of the moment; and my present sensations strongly intimated that the fiend would follow me and exempt my family from the danger of his machinations .
he is now much recovered from his illness and is continually on the deck, apparently watching for the sledge that preceded his own .
the mere presence of the idea was an irresistible proof of the fact .
i reproached myself bitterly for what i called a culpable weakness; but this weakness returned upon me whenever the critical moment approached, and i never found courage to depart .
this promise drew from me the warmest thanks .
she thanked him in the most ardent terms for his intended services towards her parent, and at the same time she gently deplored her own fate .
his rank his least merit, do you say?
for many days adrian and idris continued to visit me thus .
as it was, trembling, cold, and pale, she sought raymond .
 ''pardon me, '' he replied,  ''if i have offended .
all this appeared to me, i own, methodized madness .
would they refuse him?
 ''farewell i leave you, and in you the last of humankind whom these eyes will ever behold .
yet i fear such will be my fate; the men, unsupported by ideas of glory and honour, can never willingly continue to endure their present hardships .
when raymond offered to clear her reputation, and demonstrate to the world her real patriotism, she declared that it was only through her present sufferings that she hoped for any relief to the stings of conscience; that, in her state of mind, diseased as he might think it, the necessity of occupation was salutary medicine; she ended by extorting a promise that for the space of one month he would refrain from the discussion of her interests, engaging after that time to yield in part to his wishes .
idris, you will not act the traitor towards me? ''  ''trust me, '' replied she,  ''i will preserve a strict neutrality . ''
you came the embodied image of my fondest dreams .
years hence we shall recount to them our fears, then passed away with their occasion .
perdita smiled faintly her guest left her; the carriage rolling down the street assured the final departure .
we were fatigued by our struggles to attain this point, and seated ourselves on the rocky couch, while the sounds of tinkling sheep bells, and shout of shepherd boy, reached us from above .
nobly and greatly, he said, had the illustrious and last sovereign of england sacrificed himself to the apparent good of his country, and divested himself of a power which could only be maintained by the blood of his subjects these subjects named so no more, these, his friends and equals, had in gratitude conferred certain favours and distinctions on him and his family for ever .
 ''oh, it is not thus not thus, '' interrupted the being .
the curtain drew up, and the stage presented the scene of the witches ' cave .
my mule was brought to the door, and i resolved to ascend to the summit of montanvert .
so did he spring up from listlessness and unproductive thought, to the highest pitch of virtuous action .
she thought of the treasure she possessed in the affections of her lord; of his accomplishments, surpassing those of his contemporaries, his genius, his devotion to her .
to suspect evil, to perceive that, alfred being with us, the danger must regard her youngest darling, to fly across the long chambers into his apartment, was the work but of a moment .
and whether it were to visit beautiful scenery, or to see fine pictures, or sometimes for no object but to seek amusement as it might chance to arise, i was always happy when near my father .
the dazzling sun and glare of daylight, deprived the scene of solemnity; from evadne 's low tomb, i joined raymond and his staff, now on their way to the golden city .
a little patience, and all will be over; aye, a very little patience; for, look, there is the key of our prison; we hold it in our own hands, and are we more debased than slaves to cast it away and give ourselves up to voluntary bondage?
adrian 's chief endeavour, after the immediate succour of the sick, had been to disguise the symptoms and progress of the plague from the inhabitants of london .
she appeared of a different stock .
i should there find solitude where i might weep, and the voices of life might never reach me .
despondency rarely visited my heart; a high destiny seemed to bear me on, until i fell, never, never again to rise . ''
august th, you have read this strange and terrific story, margaret; and do you not feel your blood congeal with horror, like that which even now curdles mine?
tell me, however, in what way he passes his time; what he is doing and thinking in his cottage retreat? ''  ''nay, my sweet sister, '' replied adrian,  ''you ask me more than i can well answer; but if you feel interest in him, why not visit him?
she seemed pleased and went into the garden for some roots and plants, which she placed in water, and then upon the fire .
it were useless to record the debate that followed this harangue .
gasping, not daring to name our hopes, yet full even to the brim with intense expectation, we stood, as a ship wrecked sailor stands on a barren rock islanded by the ocean, watching a distant vessel, fancying that now it nears, and then again that it is bearing from sight .
although more than sixteen years had passed since her death nothing had been changed; her work box, her writing desk were still there and in her room a book lay open on the table as she had left it .
his soul seemed to distil itself into the words he wrote; and they breathed on the paper, bearing with them a portion of the life of love, which was his life .
i bent over her and placed the portrait securely in one of the folds of her dress .
on this occasion, my sister was not alone; nor could i fail to recognise her companion: it was idris, the till now unseen object of my mad idolatry .
i brought rosalind and miranda and the lady of comus to life to be my companions, or on my isle acted over their parts imagining myself to be in their situations .
she was uncomplaining; but the very soul of fear had taken its seat in her heart .
but i am about to die nay, interrupt me not soon i shall die .
and the remembrance fills your heart sometimes with bitter despair when otherwise your feelings would have melted into soft sorrow .
she made it her task to attend the sick, comfort the sorrowing, assist the aged, and partake the sports and awaken the gaiety of the young .
i would have prevented this; my death would be a small evil or rather i should not die; while you cannot hope to escape . ''
he hurried in, and witnessed the termination of my impassioned harangue .
after passing some months in london, we received a letter from a person in scotland who had formerly been our visitor at geneva .
the young girl was occupied in arranging the cottage; but presently she took something out of a drawer, which employed her hands, and she sat down beside the old man, who, taking up an instrument, began to play and to produce sounds sweeter than the voice of the thrush or the nightingale .
must he tax the landed interest to assist our commercial population?
a bubbling spring prattles over stones on one side, and a plantation of a few elms and beeches, hardly deserve, and yet continue the name of wood .
in the meantime he told me that my friend had certainly not many hours to live .
one man 's life or death were but a small price to pay for the acquirement of the knowledge which i sought, for the dominion i should acquire and transmit over the elemental foes of our race .
this will i do, i said .
remember that i am thy creature; i ought to be thy adam, but i am rather the fallen angel, whom thou drivest from joy for no misdeed .
she pictured to herself the anguish of his solitude; she remembered with what eager delight he had in former days made her the partner of his joyful hopes with what grateful affection he received her sympathy in his cares .
they often, i believe, suffered the pangs of hunger very poignantly, especially the two younger cottagers, for several times they placed food before the old man when they reserved none for themselves .
but the task imposed on perdita was not the less painful .

he had partially unveiled the face of nature, but her immortal lineaments were still a wonder and a mystery .
your temper is made unequal by suffering, and the tenor of your mind is, i fear, sometimes shaken by unworthy causes; but let your confidence in my sympathy and love be deeper far, and incapable of being reached by these agitations that come and go, and if they touch not your affections leave you uninjured .

perdita, who then resided with evadne, saw the torture that adrian endured .
i do not wish to take any unfair advantage, and i beg therefore that you will take some days to consider of your determination  .    '  '''it is utterly useless,' replied felix; 'we can never again inhabit your cottage.

all in my heart was shadowy yet calm, untill my ideas became confused and at length died away in sleep .
 ''my friends, '' i said,  ''our risk is common; our precautions and exertions shall be common also .
 ''rest '' she cried,  ''repose you rave, lionel if you delay we are lost; come, i pray you, unless you would cast me off for ever . ''
the tender attachment that he bore me, and the love and veneration with which i returned it cast a charm over every moment .
among the other transcendant attributes of mozart  's music, it possesses more than any other that of appearing to come from the heart; you enter into the passions expressed by him, and are transported with grief, joy, anger, or confusion, as he, our soul's master, chooses to inspire .
at length his eyes unclosed faintly, yet with a look of returning life; he became pale and weak; but the rigidity of his features was softened by approaching convalescence .
this was superstition .
plague shall not find us a ready prey; we will dispute every inch of ground; and, by methodical and inflexible laws, pile invincible barriers to the progress of our foe .
not that this indulgence was devoid of accompanying grief .
the faint rose again blushed on his cheek; his brow and lips lost the ashy paleness of threatened dissolution; such was the dear reward of my unremitting attention and bounteous heaven added overflowing recompence, when it gave me also the thanks and smiles of idris .
she had been employed in arranging for their departure; she had promised raymond during this decisive evening, to take advantage of our absence, to go one stage of the journey, and he, after his defeat was ascertained, would slip away from us, and join her .
yet why do i say this?
he remembered that he had promised perdita to be present this very evening the th of october, anniversary of his election as protector at a festival given in his honour .
we had receded from the crowd; and ascending the steps of the terrace, sought the castle .
the contents of these papers were important .
my fate has been governed by necessity, a hideous necessity .
the next evening therefore, though the autumnal change had brought on cold and rain, adrian and idris entered my cottage .
the shutting of the gates regularly at ten o 'clock and the impossibility of remaining on the lake after that hour had rendered our residence within the walls of geneva very irksome to me .

my feelings are profound, but i possessed a coolness of judgment that fitted me for illustrious achievements .
there was a considerable difference between the ages of my parents, but this circumstance seemed to unite them only closer in bonds of devoted affection .
my companion will be of the same nature as myself and will be content with the same fare .
i trod heaven in my thoughts, now exulting in my powers, now burning with the idea of their effects .
everywhere i see bliss, from which i alone am irrevocably excluded .
it may be advanced for a truth, that, if argument or entreaty can turn any one from a desperate purpose, whose motive and end depends on the strength of the affections only, then it is right so to turn them, since their docility shews, that neither the motive nor the end were of sufficient force to bear them through the obstacles attendant on their undertaking .
every breathing creature within the walls was massacred .
my heart was bleeding from its death 's wound; i could live no otherwise often amid apparent calm i was visited by despair and melancholy; gloom that nought could dissipate or overcome; a hatred of life; a carelessness of beauty; all these would by fits hold me nearly annihilated by their powers .
this enthusiasm is now spent, i know not why; i seem to myself to be entering a darksome gulph; the ardent spirit of the army is irksome to me, the rapture of triumph null . ''
i was spared the disgrace of appearing publicly as a criminal, as the case was not brought before the court that decides on life and death .
the earth, late wide circus for the display of dignified exploits, vast theatre for a magnificent drama, now presented a vacant space, an empty stage for actor or spectator there was no longer aught to say or hear .
it gave ideality to that, from which, taken in naked truth, the soul would have revolted: it bestowed pictorial colours on misery and disease, and not unfrequently relieved me from despair in deplorable changes .
although she was elder than he by nearly two years the nature of her education made her more childish at least in the knowledge and expression of feeling; she received his warm protestations with innocence, and returned them unknowing of what they meant .

the examination, the presence of the magistrate and witnesses, passed like a dream from my memory when i saw the lifeless form of henry clerval stretched before me .
so much has been done, exclaimed the soul of frankenstein more, far more, will i achieve; treading in the steps already marked, i will pioneer a new way, explore unknown powers, and unfold to the world the deepest mysteries of creation .
would that i also had a career would that i could freight some untried bark with all my hopes, energies, and desires, and launch it forth into the ocean of life bound for some attainable point, with ambition or pleasure at the helm but adverse winds detain me on shore; like ulysses, i sit at the water 's edge and weep .
i was still cold when under one of the trees i found a huge cloak, with which i covered myself, and sat down upon the ground .
but everteeming nature will create another and another, and thou wilt loose nought by my destruction .
these words were syllabled trembling by the iron man .
we forgot that malcolm and macduff were mere human beings, acted upon by such simple passions as warmed our own breasts .
the rubicon, i felt, was passed; and it behoved me well to reflect what i should do on this hither side of disease and danger .
the spirit of life seemed to linger in his form, as a dying flame on an altar flickers on the embers of an accepted sacrifice .
my mother, when dying, had, in addition to her other half forgotten and misapplied lessons, committed, with solemn exhortation, her other child to my fraternal guardianship; and this one duty i performed to the best of my ability, with all the zeal and affection of which my nature was capable .
accordingly i hid myself in some thick underwood, determining to devote the ensuing hours to reflection on my situation .
he held up the curtain of the bed; and his eyes, if eyes they may be called, were fixed on me .
you know not what you mean .
and now, behold, with the first imagination of danger, or, if you will, the first mighty and terrific trial of your courage, you shrink away and are content to be handed down as men who had not strength enough to endure cold and peril; and so, poor souls, they were chilly and returned to their warm firesides .

all that he now enjoyed would have been devoid of pleasure to him, had it been unparticipated .
his accent of bitter scorn thrilled me  ''do not tempt me to speak, '' he continued,  ''my words would scare you in an universe of cowards i dare think among the church yard tombs among the victims of his merciless tyranny i dare reproach the supreme evil .
the gamekeepers were more enraged than their lord by my obstinacy .
i can ill record the flow of language and graceful turns of expression, the wit and easy raillery that gave vigour and influence to his speech .
oh, never, never, may i see him again tomorrow night the same roof may not cover us; he or i must depart .
destiny was too potent, and her immutable laws had decreed my utter and terrible destruction .
i leaned against a tree to observe them .
perpetual fretting at length threw madame moritz into a decline, which at first increased her irritability, but she is now at peace for ever .
what a divine day how happy and serene all nature appears '' thus elizabeth endeavoured to divert her thoughts and mine from all reflection upon melancholy subjects .
elizabeth had caught the scarlet fever; her illness was severe, and she was in the greatest danger .
thus would she assuredly act if her darkened eyes opened and she beheld me .

fearing to give me pain, she hid as best she could the excess of her wretchedness, but meeting thus her brother after a long absence, she could not restrain the expression of her woe, but with all the vividness of imagination with which misery is always replete, she poured out the emotions of her heart to her beloved and sympathizing adrian .
 ''i have written myself into better spirits, dear cousin; but my anxiety returns upon me as i conclude .
were they the same waters of love, which, lately cold and cutting as ice, repelling as that, now loosened from their frozen chains, flowed through the regions of her soul in gushing and grateful exuberance?
these are the words that it contained .
for one brief interval before this catastrophe, he looked forward to the future, and contemplated with anguish the desolate situation in which his wife and children would be left .

why are there fruits, or flowers, or streams, man is not here to enjoy them?
several new kinds of plants sprang up in the garden, which they dressed; and these signs of comfort increased daily as the season advanced .
i had gazed on him while unfinished; he was ugly then, but when those muscles and joints were rendered capable of motion, it became a thing such as even dante could not have conceived .
then, as if pursued by an enemy, as if wings had been at her feet, she flew to her own apartment, she dismissed her attendants, she locked the doors, she threw herself wildly on the floor, she bit her lips even to blood to suppress her shrieks, and lay long a prey to the vulture of despair, striving not to think, while multitudinous ideas made a home of her heart; and ideas, horrid as furies, cruel as vipers, and poured in with such swift succession, that they seemed to jostle and wound each other, while they worked her up to madness .
we found him just about to embark in his boat, and he readily agreed to receive us as companions .
it is not by flying, but by facing the enemy, that we can conquer .
alas, how great was the contrast between us he was alive to every new scene, joyful when he saw the beauties of the setting sun, and more happy when he beheld it rise and recommence a new day .
again he thought, how during this long month, he had avoided perdita, flying from her as from the stings of his own conscience .
the opposite mountain is a bare perpendicular rock .
ages perhaps had elapsed since this catastrophe; and the ruin it had made above, had been repaired by the growth of vegetation during many hundred summers .
o, yes, it would countrymen, fear not in the still uncultivated wilds of america, what wonder that among its other giant destroyers, plague should be numbered it is of old a native of the east, sister of the tornado, the earthquake, and the simoon .
i had risen mechanically my knees trembled; irresolution hung on my voice, as i uttered a few words on the necessity of choosing a person adequate to the dangerous task in hand .
as i turned the promontory i perceived a small neat town and a good harbour, which i entered, my heart bounding with joy at my unexpected escape .
i could now almost fancy myself among the swiss mountains .
with regard to myself, this came almost by inheritance .
i gave several hours to the serious consideration of this difficulty, but i was obliged to relinquish all attempt to supply it, and wrapping myself up in my cloak, i struck across the wood towards the setting sun .
no man can tell there is no refuge on earth, it comes on us like a thousand packs of wolves we must all fly where shall you go?
it was dawn, and she quitted her asylum, that she might again endeavour to find my brother .
i who sought and had found joy in the love breathing countenance of my father now when i dared fix on him a supplicating look it was ever answered by an angry frown .
she then bade him, with the eloquence of despair and of unalterable love, a last farewell .

 ''the pleasant showers and genial warmth of spring greatly altered the aspect of the earth .
twice i actually hired myself as an under mate in a greenland whaler, and acquitted myself to admiration .
the hunger of death was now stung more sharply by the diminution of his food: or was it that before, the survivors being many, the dead were less eagerly counted?
at length these obnoxious visits suddenly ceased altogether, but from that moment i must date the change of my father: a change that to remember makes me shudder and then filled me with the deepest grief .
methought the charm would be broken if i were seen, but i heard the music of her voice and was happy .
by the time that she had with uneasy thoughts laid her fair cheek upon her pillow, her mother 's servant brought a draught; a suspicion again crossed her at this novel proceeding, sufficiently alarming to determine her not to take the potion; but dislike of contention, and a wish to discover whether there was any just foundation for her conjectures, made her, she said, almost instinctively, and in contradiction to her usual frankness, pretend to swallow the medicine .
thou holdest the keys of the frost, and canst first chain and then set free the streams; under thy gentle governance the buds and leaves are born, they flourish nursed by thee .
during her illness many arguments had been urged to persuade my mother to refrain from attending upon her .
she sought to improve her understanding; mechanically her heart and dispositions became soft and gentle under this benign discipline .
let the day therefore be fixed; and on it i will consecrate myself, in life or death, to the happiness of my cousin . ''
this change made us only the more sensible to the delights of the intimate intercourse of our own circle, the tranquillity of our divine forest, and our happy evenings in the halls of our beloved castle .
a south west wind brought up rain the sun came out, and mocking the usual laws of nature, seemed even at this early season to burn with solsticial force .
the boys heard with childish glee of our removal: clara asked if we were to go to athens .
i had been awake the whole of the preceding night, my nerves were agitated, and my eyes inflamed by watching and misery .
we remained for the night at luton .
i resolved to visit london, to see him; to quiet these agonizing throes by the sweet medicine of hope, or the opiate of despair .
the stranger has gradually improved in health but is very silent and appears uneasy when anyone except myself enters his cabin .
i ate my breakfast with pleasure and was about to remove a plank to procure myself a little water when i heard a step, and looking through a small chink, i beheld a young creature, with a pail on her head, passing before my hovel .
his very horse seemed to back from the fatal entrance; his dog, his faithful dog, lay moaning and supplicating in his path in a moment more, he had plunged the rowels into the sides of the stung animal, who bounded forward, and he, the gateway passed, was galloping up the broad and desart street .
perdita was all sufficient to herself .
i might be said even to love my enemies, since by exciting me they in a sort bestowed happiness upon me; perdita almost disliked her friends, for they interfered with her visionary moods .
i expressed a wish to visit england, but concealing the true reasons of this request, i clothed my desires under a guise which excited no suspicion, while i urged my desire with an earnestness that easily induced my father to comply .
the sun does not more certainly shine in the heavens than that which i now affirm is true .
combining with taste her remembrance of the edifices which she had seen in the east, and by an effort of genius enduing them with unity of design, she executed the plan which had been sent to the protector .
i asked him, if he had ever seen among the troops any one resembling her; if since he had returned to greece he had heard of her?
but your direction was northwards .
let not these aspirations be attributed to vanity .
you had mentioned geneva as the name of your native town, and towards this place i resolved to proceed .
adrian took pity on my faltering mien:  ''come with me, '' he said,  ''i have much to say to you; come home with me you know who i am? ''  ''yes, '' i exclaimed,  ''i do believe that i now know you, and that you will pardon my mistakes my crime . ''
 ''why do you call to my remembrance, '' i rejoined,  ''circumstances of which i shudder to reflect, that i have been the miserable origin and author?
burke 's reflections on the french revolution .
was my love blamable?
but now also i began to reap the fruits of my perfect solitude .
sometimes you may be stung with the feeling that you have wronged me, but the condolence of your relatives, the pity of the world, the complacency which the consciousness of your own immaculate innocence will bestow, will be excellent balm; me you will never see more '' raymond moved towards the door .
the soil was barren, scarcely affording pasture for a few miserable cows, and oatmeal for its inhabitants, which consisted of five persons, whose gaunt and scraggy limbs gave tokens of their miserable fare .
sometimes she looked at raymond, as if to say that it should be so at others her countenance expressed i will still do all i can to make you happy .
every one remarked her exhilaration of spirits; as all actions appear graceful in the eye of rank, her guests surrounded her applaudingly, although there was a sharpness in her laugh, and an abruptness in her sallies, which might have betrayed her secret to an attentive observer .
he wrote to the address given, desiring to see the draughtsman, that such alterations might be made, as should be suggested in a consultation between him and the original conceiver .
yes, divinity of the world, i read your characters in her looks and gesture; i heard your melodious voice echoed by her you prepared for us a soft and flowery path, all gentle thoughts adorned it your name, o love, was not spoken, but you stood the genius of the hour, veiled, and time, but no mortal hand, might raise the curtain .
i asked,  ''does lady idris love you? ''  ''what a question, '' replied he laughing .
i had sagacity enough to discover that the unnatural hideousness of my person was the chief object of horror with those who had formerly beheld me .
elizabeth alone had the power to draw me from these fits; her gentle voice would soothe me when transported by passion and inspire me with human feelings when sunk in torpor .
 ''the old man had, in the meantime, been pensive, but on the appearance of his companions he assumed a more cheerful air, and they sat down to eat .
he strove to shelter her, as a fair exotic is sheltered by the gardener, from every rougher wind and to surround her with all that could tend to excite pleasurable emotion in her soft and benevolent mind .

you perhaps will find some means to justify my poor guiltless justine .
although her disposition was gay and in many respects inconsiderate, yet she paid the greatest attention to every gesture of my aunt .
i may die, but in death i can never forget or desert my own clara .
as my authorship increased, i acquired new sympathies and pleasures .
the shutters had been thrown back, and with a sensation of horror not to be described, i saw at the open window a figure the most hideous and abhorred .
this appearance excited our unqualified wonder .
oh, that some encouraging voice would answer in the affirmative my courage and my resolution is firm; but my hopes fluctuate, and my spirits are often depressed .
condescend therefore to have patience with my ignorance, and to explain your wishes to me; in time i am certain that you will be satisfied . ''
the hand writing itself was exquisitely beautiful; there was something in her very paper and its folds, which even i, who did not love, and was withal unskilled in such matters, could discern as being tasteful .
yet it is in your power to recompense me, and deliver them from an evil which it only remains for you to make so great, that not only you and your family, but thousands of others, shall be swallowed up in the whirlwinds of its rage .
i have sought in vain for sleep and rest; my lids refused to close, and my blood was for ever in a tumult .
when my father returned from milan, he found playing with me in the hall of our villa a child fairer than pictured cherub a creature who seemed to shed radiance from her looks and whose form and motions were lighter than the chamois of the hills .
perdita, even where she loved, was reserved and timid; idris was frank and confiding .
perdita, shut up in herself, spoke little .
i quickly destroyed part of my sledge to construct oars, and by these means was enabled, with infinite fatigue, to move my ice raft in the direction of your ship .
the high and snowy mountains were its immediate boundaries, but i saw no more ruined castles and fertile fields .
i had been accustomed, during the night, to steal a part of their store for my own consumption, but when i found that in doing this i inflicted pain on the cottagers, i abstained and satisfied myself with berries, nuts, and roots which i gathered from a neighbouring wood .
it is certainly best not to compromise oneself by any concealment . ''
to our right the acropolis rose high, spectatress of a thousand changes, of ancient glory, turkish slavery, and the restoration of dear bought liberty; tombs and cenotaphs were strewed thick around, adorned by ever renewing vegetation; the mighty dead hovered over their monuments, and beheld in our enthusiasm and congregated numbers a renewal of the scenes in which they had been the actors .
i was not so sanguine as she as to the result of our voyage .
thus situated, employed in the most detestable occupation, immersed in a solitude where nothing could for an instant call my attention from the actual scene in which i was engaged, my spirits became unequal; i grew restless and nervous .
i was new to sorrow, but it did not the less alarm me .
scoffing devil again do i vow vengeance; again do i devote thee, miserable fiend, to torture and death .
i imagined that they would be disgusted, until, by my gentle demeanour and conciliating words, i should first win their favour and afterwards their love .
i pictured to myself a lovely river such as that on whose banks dante describes mathilda gathering flowers, which ever flows bruna, bruna, sotto l 'ombra perpetua, che mai raggiar non lascia sole ivi, ne luna .
these were wild and miserable thoughts, but i cannot describe to you how the eternal twinkling of the stars weighed upon me and how i listened to every blast of wind as if it were a dull ugly siroc on its way to consume me .
the plague is in london; the air of england is tainted, and her sons and daughters strew the unwholesome earth .
could they thrust back from the path of distinction and laudable ambition, the heir of their ancient kings, and heap another disappointment on a fallen house .
you will find him at dunkeld; gentle and tractable he wanders up the hills, and through the wood, or sits listening beside the waterfall .
alas to what loathsome shifts must i be driven?
 ''do not deceive yourself, '' replied raymond,  ''the separation at hand is one over which i have no control; most near at hand is it; the days are already counted .
his friends remembered him as a brilliant vision which would never again return to them .
i never saw any woman who excited, as elizabeth does, my warmest admiration and affection .
something told him that it was not its real evils that lay heavily at her heart, but the debasement and disgrace attendant on it; as he talked, he divested it of these; sometimes speaking of her fortitude with energetic praise; then, alluding to her past state, he called her his princess in disguise .
one evening a numerous assembly of greek chieftains were gathered together in the palace .
he was alone, examining some petitions lately presented .
i am practically industrious painstaking, a workman to execute with perseverance and labour but besides this there is a love for the marvellous, a belief in the marvellous, intertwined in all my projects, which hurries me out of the common pathways of men, even to the wild sea and unvisited regions i am about to explore .
but now, he who dies finds many companions gone before to prepare for his reception .
he meditated on what was best to be done .
there then in that castle in windsor castle, birth place of idris and my babes, should be the haven and retreat for the wrecked bark of human society .
it required all her self command, to suppress the gush of tears self pity caused at this idea .
soon after this he inquired if i thought that the breaking up of the ice had destroyed the other sledge .
that the plague was not what is commonly called contagious, like the scarlet fever, or extinct small pox, was proved .
if there is a chasm our mutual love will give us wings to pass it, and we shall find flowers, and verdure, and delight on the other side . ''
i am convinced, that had the myriad troops of asia come from over the propontis, and stood defenders of the golden city, each and every greek would have marched against the overwhelming numbers, and have devoted himself with patriotic fury for his country .
 ''i have copies of these letters, for i found means, during my residence in the hovel, to procure the implements of writing; and the letters were often in the hands of felix or agatha .
i eagerly seized the prize and returned with it to my hovel .

clara, though only twelve years old, was rendered, through extreme sensibility, so prudent and careful, that i felt secure in entrusting the charge of him to her, and it was my task to prevent idris from observing their absence .
raymond had never visited the dwellings of want, and the scene that now presented itself struck him to the heart .
you have hope, and the world before you, and have no cause for despair .
there, margaret, the sun is forever visible, its broad disk just skirting the horizon and diffusing a perpetual splendour .
it was suspected that the turks, finding themselves possessed of so illustrious a captive, resolved to satisfy their cruelty rather than their avarice, and fearful of the interference of england, had come to the determination of concealing for ever the cold blooded murder of the soldier they most hated and feared in the squadrons of their enemy .
cast away the hearts of tigers that burn in your breasts; throw down those tools of cruelty and hate; in this pause of exterminating destiny, let each man be brother, guardian, and stay to the other .
oh believe me, if you beheld on lips pale with grief one smile of joy and gratitude, and knew that you were parent of that smile, and that without you it had never been, you would feel so pure and warm a happiness that you would wish to live for ever again and again to enjoy the same pleasure .
 ''one word more concerning unkind, unjust perdita .
little could be got from the survivors; but their cautious answers caused it to be surmised that several expeditions had preceded this last, and that several turks of rank and importance had been conveyed to asia .
i revolved a thousand and a thousand plans .
what indeed could he reply to her complaints, to her griefs which she jealously paled round, keeping out all thought of remedy .
my fortunes have been, from the beginning, an exemplification of the power that mutability may possess over the varied tenor of man 's life .
if he were vanquished, i should be a free man .
i sat by his bed, watching him; his eyes were closed, and i thought he slept; but presently he called to me in a feeble voice, and bidding me come near, said,  ''alas the strength i relied on is gone; i feel that i shall soon die, and he, my enemy and persecutor, may still be in being .
we visited the wondrous cave and the little cabinets of natural history, where the curiosities are disposed in the same manner as in the collections at servox and chamounix .
but how are we to judge of airs, and pronounce in such a city plague will die unproductive; in such another, nature has provided for it a plentiful harvest?
overjoyed at this discovery, he hastened to the house, which was situated in a mean street near the reuss .
if he dies with me it is well, and there will be an end of two miserable beings; and if he will not, then will i scoff at his friendship and drink the poison before him to shame his cowardice .
even the source of colonies was dried up, for in new holland, van diemen 's land, and the cape of good hope, plague raged .
heavy misfortunes have befallen us, but let us only cling closer to what remains and transfer our love for those whom we have lost to those who yet live .
he entered attentively into all my arguments in favour of my eventual success and into every minute detail of the measures i had taken to secure it .
she never complained, but sleep and appetite fled from her, a slow fever preyed on her veins, her colour was hectic, and she often wept in secret; gloomy prognostications, care, and agonizing dread, ate up the principle of life within her .
from the side where i now stood montanvert was exactly opposite, at the distance of a league; and above it rose mont blanc, in awful majesty .
i had lived in what is generally called the world of reality, and it was awakening to a new country to find that there was a deeper meaning in all i saw, besides that which my eyes conveyed to me .
i have traversed a vast portion of the earth and have endured all the hardships which travellers in deserts and barbarous countries are wont to meet .
yet, even then, i have checked thick coming fears with one thought; i would not fear death, for the emotions that linked us must be immortal .
i, the elder of the two, was five years old when my mother died .
she was a roman catholic; and i believe her confessor confirmed the idea which she had conceived .
 ''these thoughts exhilarated me and led me to apply with fresh ardour to the acquiring the art of language .
the native modesty of his disposition conquered the joy of his triumph .
we then conversed on the plan i should pursue, and discussed the probable means of discovering his residence .
i adopted another plan .
she had been reserved and even stern in childhood; but love had softened the asperities of her character, and her union with raymond had caused her talents and affections to unfold themselves; the one betrayed, and the other lost, she in some degree returned to her ancient disposition .
the plague is now in progress it is useless closing one 's eyes to the fact the deaths encrease each week .
they endeavoured to picture forth what would then happen, and spoke in lofty terms of the prosperity of greece, when constantinople should become its capital .
